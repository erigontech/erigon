# Security Workflow — /autoresearch:security

Autonomous security auditing that uses the autoresearch loop to iteratively discover, validate, and report
vulnerabilities. Combines STRIDE threat modeling, OWASP Top 10 sweeps, and red-team adversarial analysis into a single
autonomous loop.

**Output:** A severity-ranked security report with threat model, findings, mitigations, and iteration log.

## Trigger

- User invokes `/autoresearch:security`
- User says "security audit", "run a security sweep", "threat model this codebase", "find vulnerabilities"
- User says "red-team this app", "OWASP audit", "STRIDE analysis"

## Loop Support

Works with both unbounded and bounded modes:

```
# Unlimited — keep finding vulnerabilities until interrupted
/autoresearch:security

# Bounded — run exactly N security sweep iterations
/autoresearch:security
Iterations: 10

# With target scope
/autoresearch:security
Scope: src/api/**/*.ts, src/middleware/**/*.ts
Focus: authentication and authorization flows
```

## PREREQUISITE: Interactive Setup (when invoked without flags)

**CRITICAL — BLOCKING PREREQUISITE:** If `/autoresearch:security` is invoked without `--diff`, scope, or focus, you MUST
scan the codebase first, then use `AskUserQuestion` to gather user input BEFORE proceeding to ANY phase. DO NOT skip
this step.

**Single batched call — all 3 questions at once:**

You MUST call `AskUserQuestion` with all 3 questions in ONE call:

| # | Header   | Question                                           | Options (from codebase scan)                                                                                                     |
|---|----------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | `Scope`  | "What should I audit?"                             | "Entire codebase (comprehensive)", "API routes + middleware only", "Authentication + authorization", "External-facing code only" |
| 2 | `Depth`  | "How thorough?"                                    | "Quick scan (5 iterations)", "Standard audit (15 iterations)", "Deep audit (30+ iterations)", "Unlimited"                        |
| 3 | `Action` | "What should I do with confirmed vulnerabilities?" | "Report only (read-only)", "Report + auto-fix Critical/High", "Report + CI gate (fail on critical)"                              |

**IMPORTANT:** Always ask all questions in a single call — never one at a time.

If flags are provided inline, skip interactive setup and proceed directly.

```

## Setup Phase — Threat Model Generation

### Step 1: Codebase Reconnaissance

Scan the project to build context:

```
READ:
  - package.json / requirements.txt / go.mod (dependencies)
  - .env.example / config files (secrets handling)
  - Dockerfile / docker-compose.yml (infrastructure)
  - API route files (attack surface)
  - Auth/middleware files (trust boundaries)
  - Database schemas/models (data assets)
  - CI/CD configs (supply chain)
```

### Step 2: Asset Identification

Catalog every asset that has security relevance:

| Asset Type              | Examples                                             | Priority |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| **Data stores**         | Database, Redis, file storage, cookies, localStorage | Critical |
| **Authentication**      | Login, OAuth, JWT, sessions, API keys                | Critical |
| **API endpoints**       | REST routes, GraphQL resolvers, webhooks             | High     |
| **External services**   | Payment APIs, email providers, CDN, analytics        | High     |
| **User input surfaces** | Forms, URL params, headers, file uploads             | High     |
| **Configuration**       | Environment variables, feature flags, CORS settings  | Medium   |
| **Static assets**       | Public files, uploaded content, generated files      | Low      |

### Step 3: Trust Boundary Mapping

Identify where trust levels change:

```
Trust Boundaries:
  ├── Browser ←→ Server (client-side vs server-side)
  ├── Server ←→ Database (application vs data layer)
  ├── Server ←→ External APIs (internal vs third-party)
  ├── Public routes ←→ Authenticated routes
  ├── User role ←→ Admin role (privilege levels)
  ├── CI/CD ←→ Production (deployment boundary)
  └── Container ←→ Host (infrastructure boundary)
```

### Step 4: STRIDE Threat Model

For each asset + trust boundary combination, analyze threats using STRIDE:

| Threat                     | Question                                    | Example Findings                                              |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S**poofing               | Can an attacker impersonate a user/service? | Weak auth, missing CSRF, forged JWTs                          |
| **T**ampering              | Can data be modified in transit or at rest? | Missing input validation, SQL injection, prototype pollution  |
| **R**epudiation            | Can actions be denied without evidence?     | Missing audit logs, unsigned transactions                     |
| **I**nformation Disclosure | Can sensitive data leak?                    | Error messages expose internals, PII in logs, debug endpoints |
| **D**enial of Service      | Can the service be disrupted?               | Missing rate limiting, regex DoS, resource exhaustion         |
| **E**levation of Privilege | Can a user gain unauthorized access?        | IDOR, broken access control, path traversal                   |

Output the threat model as a structured table in the security report.

### Step 5: Attack Surface Map

Generate an attack surface map showing:

```
Attack Surface:
  ├── Entry Points
  │   ├── GET /api/users/:id          → IDOR risk (user enumeration)
  │   ├── POST /api/auth/login        → Brute force, credential stuffing
  │   ├── POST /api/upload            → File upload, path traversal
  │   ├── WebSocket /ws               → Auth bypass, injection
  │   └── Webhook /api/webhooks/*     → Signature verification
  ├── Data Flows
  │   ├── User input → DB query       → Injection risk
  │   ├── JWT → route handler          → Token validation
  │   └── File upload → storage        → Malicious file execution
  └── Abuse Paths
      ├── Rate limit bypass → account takeover
      ├── IDOR chain → data exfiltration
      └── SSRF → internal service access
```

### Step 6: Baseline

Count existing security issues before the loop starts:

- Run any existing security linting (`npm audit`, `eslint-plugin-security`, `bandit`, etc.)
- Count issues as baseline metric
- Record in results log as iteration #0

## The Security Loop

### Iteration Protocol

Each iteration follows the autoresearch pattern but adapted for security:

#### Phase 1: Review (Select Attack Vector)

Priority order for selecting the next vector to test:

1. **Critical STRIDE threats** not yet tested
2. **OWASP Top 10 categories** not yet covered
3. **High-severity attack paths** from the surface map
4. **Dependency vulnerabilities** (supply chain)
5. **Configuration weaknesses** (headers, CORS, CSP)
6. **Business logic flaws** (race conditions, state manipulation)
7. **Information disclosure** (error handling, debug modes)

Track coverage in the results log. The goal is comprehensive coverage.

#### Phase 2: Analyze (Deep Dive)

For the selected vector:

1. Read all relevant code files
2. Trace data flow from entry point to data store
3. Identify missing validation, sanitization, or access checks
4. Look for known vulnerability patterns

#### Phase 3: Validate (Proof Construction)

For each potential finding, construct proof:

```
Finding Proof Structure:
  ├── Vulnerable code location (file:line)
  ├── Attack scenario (step-by-step)
  ├── Input that triggers the vulnerability
  ├── Expected vs actual behavior
  ├── Impact assessment
  └── Confidence level (Confirmed / Likely / Possible)
```

**Validation Rules:**

- **Confirmed** — Code path clearly allows the attack, no guards present
- **Likely** — Guards exist but are bypassable or incomplete
- **Possible** — Theoretical risk, depends on configuration or runtime conditions

Do NOT report findings without supporting code evidence.

#### Phase 4: Classify

Assign severity and categories:

**Severity (CVSS-inspired):**

| Severity     | Criteria                                                     |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Critical** | RCE, auth bypass, SQL injection, data breach, admin takeover |
| **High**     | XSS (stored), SSRF, privilege escalation, mass data exposure |
| **Medium**   | CSRF, open redirect, info disclosure, missing rate limits    |
| **Low**      | Missing headers, verbose errors, weak session config         |
| **Info**     | Best practice suggestions, hardening recommendations         |

**OWASP Top 10 (2021) mapping:**

| ID  | Category                               |
|-----|----------------------------------------|
| A01 | Broken Access Control                  |
| A02 | Cryptographic Failures                 |
| A03 | Injection                              |
| A04 | Insecure Design                        |
| A05 | Security Misconfiguration              |
| A06 | Vulnerable Components                  |
| A07 | Auth & Identification Failures         |
| A08 | Software & Data Integrity Failures     |
| A09 | Security Logging & Monitoring Failures |
| A10 | Server-Side Request Forgery            |

**STRIDE mapping:** Tag each finding with the applicable STRIDE category.

#### Phase 5: Log

Append to security-audit-results.tsv:

```tsv
iteration	vector	severity	owasp	stride	confidence	location	description
0	-	-	-	-	-	-	baseline — 3 npm audit warnings
1	IDOR	High	A01	EoP	Confirmed	src/api/users.ts:42	GET /api/users/:id returns any user data without ownership check
2	XSS	Medium	A03	Tampering	Likely	src/components/comment.tsx:18	User input rendered via dangerouslySetInnerHTML
3	rate-limit	Medium	A05	DoS	Confirmed	src/api/auth.ts:15	POST /login has no rate limiting — brute force possible
```

#### Phase 6: Repeat

- **Unbounded:** Keep finding vulnerabilities. Never stop. Never ask.
- **Bounded (Iterations: N):** After N iterations, generate final report and stop.
- **Coverage tracking:** Every 5 iterations, print coverage summary.

## Red-Team Adversarial Lenses

Adapted from the plan red-team workflow for security context:

### Security Adversary (Primary)
**Mindset:** "I'm a hacker trying to breach this system"
- Focus: auth bypass, injection, data exposure, privilege escalation
- Method: trace every input to its sink, find missing guards
- Priority: exploitable findings over theoretical risks

### Supply Chain Attacker
**Mindset:** "I'm compromising dependencies or build pipeline"
- Focus: dependency vulnerabilities, CI/CD weaknesses, unsigned artifacts
- Method: audit dependency tree, check for typosquatting, verify integrity
- Priority: dependencies with known CVEs, build pipeline access

### Insider Threat
**Mindset:** "I'm a malicious employee or compromised account"
- Focus: privilege escalation, data exfiltration, access control gaps
- Method: check what a low-privilege user can access, find horizontal movement
- Priority: admin bypass, bulk data export, missing audit trails

### Infrastructure Attacker
**Mindset:** "I'm attacking the deployment, not the code"
- Focus: container escape, exposed services, network segmentation
- Method: check Docker configs, K8s manifests, exposed ports, env vars
- Priority: secrets in environment, overly permissive configs

## Strix-Inspired Patterns

Learned from Strix (AI-powered security testing platform):

### Proof-of-Concept Validation
Never report a finding without proof. For each vulnerability:
1. Identify the exact code path
2. Construct a concrete exploit input
3. Trace execution through the vulnerability
4. Show the impact (data leaked, access gained, etc.)

### Multi-Agent Attack Collaboration
Each iteration should build on prior findings:
- Iteration 1 finds open endpoint → Iteration 2 chains with IDOR
- Iteration 3 finds missing rate limit → Iteration 4 tests brute force feasibility
- Findings compound. Each iteration reads past findings for chaining opportunities.

### Dynamic Analysis Verification
Where possible, suggest or construct verification commands:
```bash
# Test for missing rate limiting
for i in {1..100}; do curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://app/api/login; done

# Test for IDOR
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer USER_A_TOKEN" https://app/api/users/USER_B_ID

# Test for XSS
curl https://app/search?q=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E
```

### Comprehensive Vulnerability Categories (from Strix)

- **Access Control** — IDOR, privilege escalation, auth bypass
- **Injection Attacks** — SQL, NoSQL, command injection
- **Server-Side** — SSRF, XXE, deserialization flaws
- **Client-Side** — XSS, prototype pollution, DOM vulnerabilities
- **Business Logic** — Race conditions, workflow manipulation
- **Authentication** — JWT vulnerabilities, session management
- **Infrastructure** — Misconfigurations, exposed services

## Metric for the Loop

The security audit uses a **coverage + finding count** composite metric:

```
metric = (owasp_categories_tested / 10) * 50 + (stride_categories_tested / 6) * 30 + min(finding_count, 20)
```

- **Direction:** higher is better (more coverage + more findings = more thorough)
- **Maximum theoretical:** 50 + 30 + 20 = 100
- **Baseline:** 0 (nothing tested yet)

This incentivizes the loop to cover ALL categories before going deep on any one.

## Flags & Modes

### `--diff` — Delta Mode (v1.0.3)

Only audit files changed since the last audit. Reads the most recent `security/` subfolder to establish what was already
tested.

```
/autoresearch:security --diff
```

**How it works:**

1. Find the latest `security/*/overview.md` by timestamp in folder name
2. Parse `findings.md` from that folder to get previously tested files
3. Run `git diff --name-only {last_audit_commit}..HEAD` to find changed files
4. Scope the current audit to ONLY those changed files
5. In the final report, mark findings as:
    - **New** — found in changed files, not in previous audit
    - **Fixed** — was in previous audit, no longer present in changed code
    - **Recurring** — still present from previous audit (unchanged)

**Delta report additions:**

The overview.md gains a `## Delta Summary` section:

```markdown
## Delta Summary (vs {previous_audit_folder})

| Status | Count | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| New findings | 3 | Found in changed files |
| Fixed | 2 | No longer present |
| Recurring | 5 | Still present from last audit |
| Files changed | 12 | Since last audit |
| Files audited | 8 | (security-relevant subset) |
```

If no previous audit folder exists, `--diff` falls back to full audit with a warning.

### `--fail-on` — Severity Threshold Gate (v1.0.3)

Exit with non-zero code if findings meet or exceed a severity threshold. Designed for CI/CD blocking.

```
/autoresearch:security --fail-on critical
/autoresearch:security --fail-on high
/autoresearch:security --fail-on medium
```

| Flag Value | Blocks on                             |
|------------|---------------------------------------|
| `critical` | Any Critical finding                  |
| `high`     | Any Critical or High finding          |
| `medium`   | Any Critical, High, or Medium finding |

**Behavior:**

- Runs the full audit normally
- After generating the report, checks findings against threshold
- If threshold met: prints `SECURITY GATE FAILED: {N} findings at {severity} or above` and exits non-zero
- If threshold not met: prints `SECURITY GATE PASSED` and exits 0

**CI/CD usage:**

```bash
# In GitHub Actions or CI scripts
claude -p "/autoresearch:security --fail-on critical --iterations 10"
# Exit code 1 if any Critical findings → blocks the pipeline
```

### `--fix` — Auto-Remediation Mode

After completing the audit, switches to standard autoresearch modify→verify loop to fix confirmed findings. Uses the
security audit report as its goal.

```
/autoresearch:security --fix

/autoresearch:security --fix
Iterations: 10
```

**How it works:**

1. Run the full security audit (setup + loop + report)
2. Filter findings: only **Confirmed** severity **Critical** and **High**
3. Switch to `/autoresearch:fix` with findings context:
    - **Target:** Re-run the security checks that found each vulnerability
    - **Scope:** Files referenced in findings (file:line locations)
    - Pass the filtered findings list as context so fix knows WHAT to fix
    - Fix picks highest-severity unfixed finding each iteration
4. For each fix iteration:
    - Pick the highest-severity unfixed finding
    - Apply the mitigation from `recommendations.md`
    - Commit the fix
    - Re-verify: does the vulnerability still exist?
    - If fixed → keep commit, mark finding as "Fixed" in report
    - If still vulnerable → revert, try different approach
    - If new findings introduced → revert immediately

**Fix report additions:**

After fixes complete, updates the audit folder:

- `findings.md` gains a `Status` column: `Open` / `Fixed` / `Fix attempted`
- `recommendations.md` gains checkmarks on applied fixes
- New file: `fix-log.md` with iteration details

**Safety rules:**

- NEVER fix Low or Info findings automatically (too subjective)
- NEVER modify test files (fixes must not break existing tests)
- Run existing tests after each fix — revert if any test fails
- Maximum 3 fix attempts per finding, then skip
- User can combine with `--fail-on` for gated fix: fix first, then gate

### Combining Flags

Flags can be combined:

```
# Delta audit + auto-fix critical/high + block on remaining criticals
/autoresearch:security --diff --fix --fail-on critical
Iterations: 15

# Quick delta check in CI
/autoresearch:security --diff --fail-on high
Iterations: 5
```

**Execution order when combined:**

1. `--diff` narrows scope
2. Security audit runs (with narrowed scope if `--diff`)
3. `--fix` runs remediation loop on confirmed Critical/High
4. `--fail-on` checks remaining (unfixed) findings against threshold

### CI/CD GitHub Action Template

When `/autoresearch:security` detects a `.github/workflows/` directory, it offers to generate a security workflow:

```
AskUserQuestion:
  question: "I see you use GitHub Actions. Want me to generate a security audit workflow?"
  header: "CI/CD"
  options:
    - label: "Yes, generate it (Recommended)"
      description: "Creates .github/workflows/security-audit.yml"
    - label: "No, skip"
      description: "Continue without CI/CD setup"
```

**Generated workflow:** `.github/workflows/security-audit.yml`

```

**The template is generated ONCE** — after initial creation, it's the user's file to customize.

### Historical Comparison

When a previous audit exists in `security/`, the current run automatically generates a comparison section.

**Detection:** At setup, scan `security/` for existing audit folders sorted by date.

**Comparison logic:**

```
For each finding in current audit:
  Search previous audit findings.md for same location (file:line) or same description
  If found → mark as "Recurring"
  If not found → mark as "New"

For each finding in previous audit:
  Search current audit findings for same location or description
  If not found → mark as "Fixed"
```

**Output in overview.md:**

```markdown
## Historical Comparison

**Previous audit:** security/260310-1430-stride-owasp-full-audit/ (5 days ago)

### Trend
| Metric | Previous | Current | Change |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| Critical | 3 | 1 | ↓ -2 (improved) |
| High | 4 | 5 | ↑ +1 (regressed) |
| Medium | 2 | 3 | ↑ +1 |
| Total | 9 | 9 | → 0 |
| OWASP coverage | 6/10 | 8/10 | ↑ +2 |
| STRIDE coverage | 4/6 | 5/6 | ↑ +1 |

### Finding Status
| Status | Count | Details |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Fixed since last audit | 4 | JWT algo, CORS, 2 XSS |
| New findings | 4 | SSRF, rate limit, 2 IDOR |
| Recurring (unfixed) | 5 | See findings.md |

### Regression Alert
⚠️ 4 new findings detected since last audit. Review [findings.md](./findings.md) for details.
```

**findings.md additions:**

Each finding gets a `History` tag:

- `🆕 New` — first time detected
- `🔄 Recurring` — present in previous audit too
- `✅ Fixed` (only in previous audit's context) — no longer present

## Error Recovery

| Error                      | Recovery                                                |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Can't determine tech stack | Ask user for framework/language                         |
| No API routes found        | Scan for all exported functions with HTTP-like patterns |
| Dependency audit fails     | Skip, note in report, continue with code analysis       |
| Code too large for context | Focus on files matching attack surface (API, auth, DB)  |
| False positive suspected   | Mark as "Possible" confidence, include caveats          |

## Anti-Patterns

- **Do NOT report theoretical risks without code evidence** — every finding needs a file:line reference
- **Do NOT skip categories** — the loop should aim for 100% OWASP + STRIDE coverage
- **Do NOT auto-fix vulnerabilities** — report only, user decides what to fix
- **Do NOT test against live production** — analyze code statically, suggest dynamic tests
- **Do NOT report the same finding twice** — check results log for duplicates before logging
- **Do NOT prioritize quantity over quality** — 5 confirmed critical > 50 theoretical lows

## Report Output — Structured Folder

Every `/autoresearch:security` run creates a dedicated folder inside a `security/` directory at the project root (
similar to how `/plan --hard` creates plan directories).

### Folder Structure

```
{project_root}/
└── security/
    ├── 260315-0945-stride-owasp-full-audit/
    │   ├── overview.md                    ← Executive summary + links to all reports
    │   ├── threat-model.md                ← STRIDE threat model (assets, boundaries, threats)

```

### Folder Naming Convention

```
security/{YYMMDD}-{HHMM}-{audit-type-slug}/
```

| Component         | Source                    | Example                   |
|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| `YYMMDD`          | Current date              | `260315`                  |
| `HHMM`            | Current time (24h)        | `0945`                    |
| `audit-type-slug` | Inferred from scope/focus | `stride-owasp-full-audit` |

**Slug generation rules:**

- If no scope/focus specified → `stride-owasp-full-audit`
- If scope is auth-related → `auth-authorization-audit`
- If scope is API-related → `api-security-audit`
- If scope is infra-related → `infrastructure-security-audit`
- If user provides a focus string → kebab-case it (e.g., "payment flow" → `payment-flow-audit`)

### 1. Restrict JWT Algorithm
**Finding:** [JWT Algorithm Confusion](./findings.md#finding-2)
**Effort:** 5 minutes
**Fix:**
\```typescript
// Before (vulnerable)
jwt.verify(token, secret);

// After (secure)
jwt.verify(token, secret, { algorithms: ['HS256'] });
\```

### 2. Add IDOR Protection
...

## Priority 2 — High (Fix This Sprint)
...

## Priority 3 — Medium (Plan for Next Sprint)
...
```

### Creation Protocol

1. At the **start** of `/autoresearch:security`, create the folder:
   ```
   mkdir -p security/{YYMMDD}-{HHMM}-{slug}
   ```

2. During the **Setup Phase**, write:
    - `threat-model.md` (after STRIDE analysis)
    - `attack-surface-map.md` (after surface mapping)
    - `security-audit-results.tsv` (header row + baseline iteration)

3. During the **Loop**, append to:
    - `security-audit-results.tsv` (after each iteration)

4. At **completion** (bounded loop end or interrupt), write:
    - `findings.md` (all findings consolidated)
    - `owasp-coverage.md` (coverage matrix)
    - `dependency-audit.md` (tool output)
    - `recommendations.md` (prioritized mitigations)
    - `overview.md` (executive summary — written LAST, links to all other files)

5. Print the folder path to the user:
   ```
   Security audit complete. Report saved to:
   security/260315-0945-stride-owasp-full-audit/overview.md
   ```

### Gitignore

Add to `.gitignore` (if not already present):

```
security-audit-results.tsv
```

The `.tsv` iteration log is a working file. The `.md` reports are meant to be committed and shared.
