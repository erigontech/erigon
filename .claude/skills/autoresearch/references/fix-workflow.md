# Fix Workflow — /autoresearch:fix

Autonomous fix loop that takes a broken state and iteratively repairs it until everything passes. One fix per iteration.
Atomic, committed, verified, auto-reverted on failure.

**Core idea:** Detect → Prioritize → Fix ONE thing → Verify → Keep/Revert → Repeat until zero errors.

## Trigger

- User invokes `/autoresearch:fix`
- User says "fix all errors", "make tests pass", "fix the build", "clean up all warnings"
- User has output from `/autoresearch:debug` and wants to fix the findings

## Loop Support

```
# Unlimited — keep fixing until everything passes
/autoresearch:fix

# Bounded — exactly N fix iterations
/autoresearch:fix
Iterations: 30

# With explicit target
/autoresearch:fix
Target: make all tests pass
Scope: src/**/*.ts
Guard: npm run typecheck
```

## PREREQUISITE: Interactive Setup (when invoked without flags)

**CRITICAL — BLOCKING PREREQUISITE:** If `/autoresearch:fix` is invoked without explicit `--target`, `--guard`, or
`--scope`, you MUST first auto-detect all failures, then use `AskUserQuestion` to gather user input BEFORE proceeding to
ANY phase. DO NOT skip this step. DO NOT jump to Phase 1 without completing interactive setup.

**Pre-scan:** Run test suite, type checker, linter, and build to detect failures. Present summary in the first question.

**Single batched call — all 4 questions at once:**

You MUST call `AskUserQuestion` with all 4 questions in ONE call:

| # | Header     | Question                                                                        | Options (from auto-detection)                                                 |
|---|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | `Fix What` | "Found [N] test failures, [M] type errors, [K] lint errors. What should I fix?" | "Fix everything (recommended)", "Only tests", "Only type errors", "Only lint" |
| 2 | `Guard`    | "What command must ALWAYS pass? (prevents fixes from breaking other things)"    | "npm test", "tsc --noEmit", "npm run build", "Skip — no guard"                |
| 3 | `Scope`    | "Which files can I modify?"                                                     | Suggested globs from error locations + "All project files"                    |
| 4 | `Launch`   | "Ready to fix?"                                                                 | "Fix until zero errors", "Fix with iteration limit", "Edit config", "Cancel"  |

**IMPORTANT:** Always ask all 4 questions in a single call — never one at a time. Users need the full picture (what's
broken, what's the guard, what's the scope) to make informed decisions together.

If the user provides `--target`, `--guard`, `--scope`, or `--from-debug` flags, skip the interactive setup and proceed
directly to Phase 1.

## Architecture

```
/autoresearch:fix
  ├── Phase 1: Detect (what's broken?)
  ├── Phase 2: Prioritize (fix order)
  ├── Phase 3: Fix ONE thing (atomic change)
  ├── Phase 4: Commit (before verification)
  ├── Phase 5: Verify (did error count decrease?)
  ├── Phase 6: Guard (did anything else break?)
  ├── Phase 7: Decide (keep / revert / rework)
  └── Phase 8: Log & Repeat
```

## Phase 1: Detect — What's Broken?

**STOP: Have you completed the Interactive Setup above?** If invoked without `--target`/`--guard`/`--scope` flags, you
MUST complete the `AskUserQuestion` call above BEFORE entering this phase.

Auto-detect the failure domain from context, or accept explicit target.

**Detection algorithm:**

```
FUNCTION detectFailures(context):
  failures = []

  # Run test suite
  IF test runner detected (jest, pytest, vitest, go test, cargo test):
    result = run_tests()
    IF failures → ADD {type: "test", count: N, details: [...]}

  # Run type checker
  IF typescript detected:
    result = run("tsc --noEmit")
    IF errors → ADD {type: "type", count: N, details: [...]}

  # Run linter
  IF linter detected (eslint, ruff, clippy):
    result = run_lint()
    IF errors → ADD {type: "lint", count: N, details: [...]}

  # Run build
  IF build script detected:
    result = run_build()
    IF fails → ADD {type: "build", count: 1, details: [...]}

  # Check for debug findings
  IF debug/{latest}/findings.md exists:
    bugs = parse_findings()
    ADD {type: "bug", count: N, details: [...]}

  # Check CI
  IF .github/workflows/ exists:
    IF user mentions CI failure → ADD {type: "ci", count: 1, details: [...]}

  # Detect warnings (lower priority but tracked)
  IF warning-level output detected:
    result = run_warnings()
    IF warnings → ADD {type: "warning", count: N, details: [...]}

  RETURN failures sorted by severity
```

**Output:** `✓ Phase 1: Detected — [N] test failures, [M] type errors, [K] lint errors, [W] warnings`

**Detection priority note:** Run build first — if build fails, type/test/lint results are unreliable. Warnings are
detected last; {type: "warning"} items go to lowest priority queue.

## Phase 2: Prioritize — Fix Order

Fix in this order (blockers first, polish last):

| Priority | Category               | Why First                                 |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1        | **Build failures**     | Nothing works if it doesn't compile       |
| 2        | **Critical/High bugs** | From debug findings — data loss, security |
| 3        | **Type errors**        | Type safety prevents cascading bugs       |
| 4        | **Test failures**      | Tests verify correctness                  |
| 5        | **Medium/Low bugs**    | From debug findings                       |
| 6        | **Lint errors**        | Code quality                              |
| 7        | **Warnings**           | Polish — type "warning" in detection      |

**Within a category, prioritize by:**

1. Cascading impact (fixing one may fix others downstream)
2. Simplicity (quick wins first — build momentum)
3. File locality (fixes in same file grouped)

**Output:** `✓ Phase 2: Prioritized — fixing [category] first ([N] items)`

## Phase 3: Fix ONE Thing — Atomic Change

Pick the highest-priority unfixed item and make ONE focused change.

**Fix strategies by category:**

| Category         | Strategy                                                                 |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Build failure    | Read error, fix the exact line/import/config                             |
| Type error       | Add proper types, fix signatures, handle null cases                      |
| Test failure     | Read test + implementation, find mismatch, fix implementation (not test) |
| Lint error       | Apply the rule — auto-fix where possible                                 |
| Bug (from debug) | Apply the suggested fix from findings.md                                 |
| Warning          | Resolve the underlying issue, don't suppress                             |

**Fix Strategies by Language:**

| Language   | Never Do                                                | Correct Pattern                                                                    |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TypeScript | `any`, `@ts-ignore`, type assertions to bypass          | Proper interfaces, generics, discriminated unions                                  |
| Python     | Bare `except:`, missing type hints on public API        | `except SpecificError:`, full type hints with `from __future__ import annotations` |
| Go         | Ignoring errors with `_`, `panic` in library code       | Explicit error wrapping `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`, propagate with context   |
| Rust       | `.unwrap()` in production, silencing `#[allow(unused)]` | `Result<T, E>` propagation with `?`, custom error types with `thiserror`           |
| Java       | Swallowing exceptions, raw types                        | Typed exceptions, generics, checked exception handling                             |

**Rules:**

- ONE fix per iteration. Not two. Not "while I'm here."
- Fix the IMPLEMENTATION, not the test (unless the test is genuinely wrong)
- Never add `@ts-ignore`, `eslint-disable`, `# type: ignore` to suppress errors
- Never use any|any escape hatch never solves type errors — use proper narrowed types or generics
- Never delete test|delete test coverage never improves code — fix the implementation to satisfy tests
- Prefer minimal changes — smallest diff that fixes the issue

## Phase 4: Commit — Before Verification

```bash
git add <modified-files>
git commit -m "fix: [what was fixed] — [file:line]"
```

Commit BEFORE running verification. This enables clean rollback if the fix breaks something.

## Phase 5: Verify — Did It Help?

Re-run the detection from Phase 1 and compare:

```
previous_errors = error_count_before
current_errors = error_count_after

delta = previous_errors - current_errors
```

**Expected:** `delta > 0` (fewer errors than before)

## Phase 6: Guard — Did Anything Else Break?

If a guard command is specified, run it:

```
guard_result = run(guard_command)  # e.g., "npm test"
```

**Guard prevents regressions.** Fixing a type error shouldn't break a test. Fixing a test shouldn't break the build.

## Phase 7: Decide — Keep, Revert, or Rework

| Condition                    | Action                                                       |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `delta > 0` AND guard passes | **KEEP** — commit stays, log "fixed"                         |
| `delta > 0` AND guard fails  | **REWORK** — revert, try different approach (max 2 attempts) |
| `delta == 0`                 | **DISCARD** — revert, fix didn't help                        |
| `delta < 0` (more errors!)   | **DISCARD** — revert immediately                             |
| Crash during fix             | **RECOVER** — revert, try simpler approach (max 3 attempts)  |

**Rework strategy (when guard fails):**

1. Read the guard failure — understand what regressed
2. Revert the failing fix: `git revert HEAD --no-edit`
3. Understand why the fix broke something else (check cascading dependencies)
4. Find an approach that fixes the target WITHOUT breaking the guard
5. If 2 rework attempts fail → skip this item, add to `blocked.md`, move to next
6. Log in fix-results.tsv with status "rework" and description of what was attempted

**Decision matrix extended:**

| Condition             | delta | Guard | Action              | TSV Status |
|-----------------------|-------|-------|---------------------|------------|
| Perfect fix           | > 0   | pass  | KEEP                | fixed      |
| Partial fix           | > 0   | pass  | KEEP + continue     | fixed      |
| Regression introduced | > 0   | fail  | REWORK              | rework     |
| No effect             | == 0  | -     | DISCARD             | discard    |
| Made it worse         | < 0   | -     | DISCARD immediately | discard    |
| Crash/exception       | any   | fail  | RECOVER (simpler)   | recover    |
| 3rd attempt fails     | any   | any   | SKIP to blocked     | blocked    |

## Phase 8: Log & Repeat

**Append to fix-results.tsv:**

```tsv
iteration	category	target	delta	guard	status	description
0	-	-	-	pass	baseline	47 test failures, 12 type errors, 3 lint errors
1	type	auth.ts:42	-2	pass	fixed	add return type annotation
2	type	db.ts:15	-1	pass	fixed	handle nullable column
3	test	api.test.ts	-3	pass	fixed	fix expected status code (was 200, should be 201)
4	test	auth.test.ts	0	-	discard	wrong approach — test expectation was correct
5	test	auth.test.ts	-1	pass	fixed	missing await on async handler
```

**Every 5 iterations, print progress:**

```
=== Fix Progress (iteration 15) ===
Baseline: 62 errors → Current: 23 errors (-39, -63%)
Category breakdown:
  Tests:  31/47 fixed
  Types:  8/12 fixed
  Lint:   0/3 fixed (not yet started — lower priority)
Keeps: 11 | Discards: 3 | Reworks: 1
```

**Completion detection:**

```
IF current_errors == 0:
  PRINT "=== All Clear — Zero Errors ==="
  STOP (even in unbounded mode)
```

## Flags

| Flag                 | Purpose                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `--target <command>` | Explicit verify command (overrides auto-detection)        |
| `--guard <command>`  | Safety command that must always pass                      |
| `--scope <glob>`     | Limit fixes to specific files                             |
| `--category <type>`  | Only fix specific category (test, type, lint, build, bug) |
| `--skip-lint`        | Don't fix lint errors (focus on functional issues)        |
| `--from-debug`       | Read findings from latest debug/ session                  |

## Fix Session State Machine

```
States: DETECTING → PRIORITIZING → FIXING → VERIFYING → DECIDING → [DONE | LOOP]

DETECTING:
  → Run all error detection commands
  → If zero errors found → DONE (nothing to fix)
  → If errors found → PRIORITIZING

PRIORITIZING:
  → Sort errors by priority table
  → Group cascading errors (fixing one fixes others)
  → Pick first unfixed item → FIXING

FIXING:
  → Read error details + surrounding code
  → Assess blast radius (impact assessment)
  → Check git history for prior attempts on this file
  → Apply minimal change
  → Commit → VERIFYING

VERIFYING:
  → Re-run error detection
  → Compute delta (previous - current)
  → Run guard command → DECIDING

DECIDING:
  → delta > 0 AND guard passes → KEEP → log "fixed" → LOOP
  → delta > 0 AND guard fails → REWORK (max 2) → FIXING
  → delta == 0 → DISCARD → revert → PRIORITIZING (next item)
  → delta < 0 → DISCARD → revert immediately → PRIORITIZING
  → 3 failed attempts on same item → SKIP → blocked list → PRIORITIZING
  → All items fixed or skipped → DONE

DONE:
  → Generate summary.md
  → Print fix_score
  → Suggest /autoresearch:debug for blocked items
```

## What NOT to Do — Anti-Patterns

These shortcuts seem to fix the error but make things worse:

| Anti-Pattern                                | Why It's Wrong                                     | Do This Instead                                         |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Add `@ts-ignore` / `eslint-disable`         | Hides the problem — resurfaces as runtime error    | Fix the root cause                                      |
| Use `any` type to silence TypeScript        | Defeats type safety for the whole chain            | Use proper types, generics, or `unknown` with narrowing |
| Delete or skip failing tests                | Removes the safety net                             | Fix the implementation to satisfy the test              |
| Suppress lint with inline comments          | Accumulates tech debt silently                     | Apply the lint rule correctly                           |
| `catch (e) {}` empty catch blocks           | Swallows errors — bugs become invisible            | Log at minimum; handle or re-throw                      |
| Comment out broken code                     | It will never be uncommented                       | Fix it or delete it entirely                            |
| Hardcode values to pass specific tests      | Test passes, but feature is broken for real data   | Fix the logic, not the values                           |
| `--force` on npm/yarn install               | Ignores peer dep conflicts causing runtime crashes | Resolve conflicts explicitly                            |
| Increase test timeouts without fixing cause | Masks slow code or deadlocks                       | Profile and fix the underlying issue                    |

**The ONE fix rule prevents most anti-patterns.** When tempted to use one, it signals the real fix is harder — log it,
skip to next item, return with fresh context.

## Fix Verification Depth

Verification depth scales with blast radius:

| Change Scope            | Minimum Verification         | Full Verification                    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Single utility function | Unit tests for that function | Unit + integration tests for callers |
| Public API change       | Integration tests            | Unit + integration + contract tests  |
| Database schema         | Migration dry-run            | Staging environment smoke test       |
| Config / env var        | CI pipeline run              | Full deployment to staging           |
| Dependency upgrade      | `npm test`                   | Full regression suite + e2e          |
| Auth / security code    | Unit + integration           | Security audit + penetration test    |

## Composite Metric

For bounded loops, a nuanced fix_score accounting for quality of fixes:

```
fix_score = reduction_score + quality_score + bonus_score

reduction_score = ((baseline_errors - current_errors) / baseline_errors) * 60
  # Weight: 60% — primary goal is reducing errors

quality_score = 0
  # Deduct for low-quality fixes (anti-patterns used):
  quality_score -= (suppression_count * 5)   # @ts-ignore, eslint-disable used
  quality_score -= (skipped_test_count * 10)  # tests deleted/commented out
  quality_score -= (any_type_count * 3)       # `any` type introduced
  quality_score = max(quality_score, -20)     # floor: never below -20

guard_score = (guard_always_passed ? 25 : 0)
  # Weight: 25% — no regressions is critical

bonus_score = 0
  bonus_score += (zero_errors ? 10 : 0)              # all clear bonus
  bonus_score += (no_discards ? 5 : 0)               # every fix worked first try
  bonus_score += (compound_detected_and_fixed ? 5 : 0) # found hidden bugs too
```

**Interpretation:**

- **100+** = perfect: all errors fixed, no regressions, no anti-patterns
- **80-99** = good: significant progress, guards held, minimal anti-patterns
- **60-79** = acceptable: meaningful reduction, but some regressions or anti-patterns
- **<60** = needs work: too many discards, guard failures, or anti-patterns used

## Fix Impact Assessment

Before applying a fix, estimate the blast radius:

```
FUNCTION assessImpact(target_file, fix_type):
  # How many files import this file?
  dependents = grep -r "import.*{target_file}" src/

  # Is this in a critical path?
  is_critical = target_file in [auth, payments, database, api-gateway]

  # How many tests cover this?
  test_coverage = count tests that import or test target_file

  RETURN {
    dependents: N,
    is_critical: bool,
    test_coverage: N,
    risk_level: HIGH if (dependents > 10 OR is_critical) else MEDIUM if dependents > 3 else LOW
  }
```

| Risk Level | Action                                                                      |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LOW        | Fix and verify with unit tests                                              |
| MEDIUM     | Fix with unit + integration tests as guard                                  |
| HIGH       | Fix in isolation branch, verify against full suite, get review before merge |

## Compound Fix Detection

When fixing one error reveals another, or a fix is only partial:

```
FUNCTION detectCompound(before_errors, after_errors):
  new_errors = after_errors - before_errors  # errors that didn't exist before

  IF new_errors > 0:
    LOG "Compound fix detected: {N} new errors surfaced"
    # These are likely pre-existing errors that were masked
    ADD new_errors to fix queue at current priority
    CONTINUE (do not treat as regression)

  IF delta == 0 AND error_details_changed:
    LOG "Error transformed — not fixed, just moved"
    REVERT and try different approach
```

**Common compound patterns:**

- Fixing a type error reveals a logic error that the wrong type was hiding
- Fixing a null check reveals a missing initialization
- Upgrading a dependency reveals previously passing tests were relying on a bug
- Fixing test A reveals test B was sharing mutable state

## Rollback Protocol

When a fix makes things worse (delta < 0) or breaks the guard:

```
STEP 1: Identify the bad commit
  git log --oneline -5

STEP 2: Revert the specific commit
  git revert HEAD --no-edit
  # OR for harder cases:
  git reset --soft HEAD~1  # unstage the commit
  git checkout -- .        # discard working changes

STEP 3: Verify rollback succeeded
  Run original failing command — should return to pre-fix error count

STEP 4: Log the failed approach in fix-results.tsv
  Mark as "discard" with description of why it failed

STEP 5: Analyze before retrying
  - What assumption was wrong?
  - What did the fix break?
  - Is there a smaller, safer change?
```

**Never skip rollback.** A partial fix in a broken state makes the next iteration's error detection unreliable.

## Parallel Fix Detection

Some errors are independent and can be fixed in parallel (separate files, no shared state):

```
FUNCTION detectParallelizable(error_list):
  groups = {}

  FOR each error:
    affected_files = error.file
    FOR each group:
      IF affected_files overlaps group.files:
        MERGE error into group  # dependent
      ELSE:
        CREATE new group        # independent

  independent_groups = groups where len(group.files) == 1

  RETURN independent_groups  # can be fixed in parallel subagents
```

**When to parallelize:** 5+ independent errors across different modules. Spawn parallel fix agents with `--scope` to
isolate.

## Fix History Pattern Learning

Before attempting a fix, check git history for past approaches on the same file:

```bash
# See what fixes were tried in this file before
git log --oneline --follow -- src/auth/handler.ts

# See the diff of a specific past fix
git show <commit-hash> -- src/auth/handler.ts

# Search for past fix attempts on this error type
git log --grep="fix: type error" --oneline
```

**Pattern signals:**

- Same error fixed 3+ times → root cause not addressed, fix the architectural issue
- Recent revert in same file → previous approach failed, avoid repeating it
- Large diff for "simple" fix → complexity hidden in that file, be careful with changes

## The Fix Didn't Work — Escalation Path

When 3 attempts at the same error fail:

```
Attempt 1: FAIL → Log approach, try different strategy
Attempt 2: FAIL → Log approach, read git history for prior attempts
Attempt 3: FAIL → Escalate:

  1. DOCUMENT: What was tried (3 approaches), why each failed
  2. ISOLATE: Create minimal reproduction case
  3. SKIP: Move this error to "blocked" list, continue with others
  4. FLAG: Note in summary.md — "Error X requires investigation"
  5. SUGGEST: /autoresearch:debug on the specific error for root cause analysis
```

**Never loop on the same failing approach.** Each attempt must use a materially different strategy.

## Dependency Fix Patterns

When the error originates from `node_modules`, `pip` packages, or vendored dependencies:

| Symptom                         | Strategy                      | Command                                    |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Peer dependency conflict        | Upgrade to compatible version | `npm install pkg@latest`                   |
| Breaking change in minor update | Pin to last working version   | `npm install pkg@1.2.3`                    |
| Security vulnerability          | Patch or replace              | `npm audit fix` / replace with alternative |
| Transitive dependency conflict  | Force resolution              | `package.json` resolutions/overrides field |
| Python package incompatibility  | Pin in requirements           | `pip install pkg==x.y.z`                   |
| Missing native bindings         | Rebuild from source           | `npm rebuild` / `pip install --no-binary`  |

**Rule:** Never vendor-patch `node_modules` directly — it will be overwritten. Add a `patch-package` patch or fork.

## Database Migration Fix Patterns

When errors involve schema conflicts or data integrity:

| Error Type                      | Strategy                                                                                               |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Migration out of order          | Check migration history table, apply missing migrations in sequence                                    |
| Schema conflict (column exists) | Make migration idempotent: `IF NOT EXISTS` / `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`                                |
| Data integrity violation        | Fix data BEFORE applying constraint, or migrate in two steps: add nullable → backfill → add constraint |
| Failed rollback                 | Restore from backup, replay forward migrations to known-good point                                     |
| Enum type conflict (Postgres)   | Cannot alter enums in transactions — use `ALTER TYPE` outside transaction block                        |

**Rule:** Always test migrations on a copy of production data before applying. Use `--dry-run` if available.

## CI/CD Pipeline Fix Patterns

When errors appear only in CI (not locally):

| Symptom                    | Root Cause                              | Fix                                                            |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `env var not found`        | Secret not in CI environment            | Add secret to CI settings, reference via `${{ secrets.NAME }}` |
| Permission denied          | Missing IAM role / workflow permissions | Add `permissions:` block to workflow YAML                      |
| Timeout                    | Slow test / missing cache               | Add caching step, increase timeout, parallelize jobs           |
| Works locally, fails in CI | OS difference (macOS vs Linux)          | Test in Docker matching CI OS; check path case sensitivity     |
| Flaky test in CI           | Race condition or timing                | Add retry logic, fix async handling, isolate test state        |
| Cache poisoning            | Stale cache from broken state           | Clear CI cache, add cache key version bump                     |

| `debug/*/findings.md` exists             | bug           | Parse findings                            |
| `tsc --noEmit` shows `TS2322`, `TS2345`  | type error    | Fix type mismatch                         |

| build log shows `Module not found`       | build failure | Fix import path                           |
| CI log shows `exit code 1`               | ci            | Inspect failed step                       |

## Chaining Patterns

```bash
# Debug first, then fix what was found
/autoresearch:debug
Iterations: 15

/autoresearch:fix --from-debug
Iterations: 30

# Fix with guard
/autoresearch:fix
Target: npm run typecheck
Guard: npm test

# Fix only tests, guard with types
/autoresearch:fix --category test --guard "tsc --noEmit"

# Fix everything — iterate until clean
/autoresearch:fix

# Bounded sprint — fix as many as you can in 20 iterations
/autoresearch:fix
Iterations: 20
```

## Output Directory

Creates `fix/{YYMMDD}-{HHMM}-{fix-slug}/` with:

- `fix-results.tsv` — iteration log
- `summary.md` — what was fixed, what remains, stats
- `blocked.md` — errors that needed 3+ attempts and were escalated
- `impact-assessment.md` — blast radius analysis for each fix applied

## Extended Chaining Patterns

```bash
# Full pipeline: debug → fix → ship
/autoresearch:debug
Iterations: 15

/autoresearch:fix --from-debug --guard "npm test"
Iterations: 30

/autoresearch:ship

# Fix only critical issues, then verify clean
/autoresearch:fix --category build
/autoresearch:fix --category type --guard "npm run build"
/autoresearch:fix --category test --guard "tsc --noEmit"

# Scoped fix with parallel agents
/autoresearch:fix --scope "src/api/**" --category type
/autoresearch:fix --scope "src/auth/**" --category test

# Fix with warning suppression disabled
/autoresearch:fix --category warning --skip-lint

# CI-specific fix: re-run on CI failure
/autoresearch:fix --target "npm run ci" --guard "npm test"

# After dependency upgrade: fix cascade
npm upgrade && /autoresearch:fix --category type --category test
```

## Summary Report Format

```markdown
# Fix Session Summary

## Stats
- Session: fix/260316-1805-auth-fixes/
- Duration: 23 iterations
- Baseline: 47 errors (31 test, 12 type, 4 lint)
- Final: 3 errors (2 test, 1 type, 0 lint)
- Reduction: 93.6% (-44 errors)

## Fix Score
fix_score: 97/100
- Reduction: 58/60 (93.6%)
- Guard: 25/25 (no regressions)
- Bonus: +10 (zero lint errors)
- Anti-patterns used: 0

## Fixed
- auth.ts:42 — add return type annotation (type)
- db.ts:15 — handle nullable column (type)
- api.test.ts — fix expected status code 200→201 (test)
[... 41 more ...]

## Blocked (requires investigation)
- auth/token-refresh.ts — circular dependency blocks type resolution
  → Suggested: /autoresearch:debug --scope auth/token-refresh.ts

## Remaining
- user.test.ts:88 — flaky timing test (not a code bug)
- config.ts:12 — type error requires breaking API change
```
