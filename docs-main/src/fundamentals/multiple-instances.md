# Multiple instances / One machine [REVIEW]

Erigon supports running multiple instances on the same machine by configuring distinct ports and data directories for each instance. Multiple instances are fully supported but require careful configuration to avoid port conflicts and resource contention. The modular architecture allows for flexible deployment patterns, from fully integrated instances to distributed service architectures. The primary consideration is the performance impact from shared disk access, especially during initial synchronization phases.

## Required Configuration Flags

To avoid conflicts between instances, you must define **6 essential flags** for each instance:

- `--datadir` - Separate data directory for each instance
- `--port` - P2P networking port (default: `30303`)
- `--http.port` - HTTP JSON-RPC port (default: `8545`)
- `--authrpc.port` - Engine API port (default: `8551`)
- `--torrent.port` - BitTorrent protocol port (default: `42069`)
- `--private.api.addr` - Internal gRPC API address (default: `127.0.0.1:9090`)

## Example Configuration

Here's how to run mainnet and sepolia instances simultaneously:

```bash
# Mainnet instance
./build/bin/erigon \
  --datadir="<your_mainnet_data_path>" \
  --chain=mainnet \
  --port=30303 \
  --http.port=8545 \
  --authrpc.port=8551 \
  --torrent.port=42069 \
  --private.api.addr=127.0.0.1:9090 \
  --http --ws \
  --http.api=eth,debug,net,trace,web3,erigon

# Sepolia instance
./build/bin/erigon \
  --datadir="<your_sepolia_data_path>" \
  --chain=sepolia \
  --port=30304 \
  --http.port=8546 \
  --authrpc.port=8552 \
  --torrent.port=42068 \
  --private.api.addr=127.0.0.1:9091 \
  --http --ws \
  --http.api=eth,debug,net,trace,web3,erigon
```

## Docker Compose Multi-Instance Setup

For containerized deployments, the docker-compose configuration shows how services can be orchestrated with proper port isolation:

The compose file demonstrates the port allocation strategy:
- **9090-9094**: Internal gRPC services (execution, sentry, consensus, downloader, txpool)
- **8545, 8551**: External HTTP APIs
- **30303, 42069**: P2P networking ports

## Best Practices

### 1. Resource Management

**Memory Considerations:**
Erigon uses memory-mapped files (MDBX) where the OS manages page cache. Multiple instances will share the same page cache efficiently, but be aware that:

- Each instance uses ~4GB RAM during genesis sync and ~1GB during normal operation
- OS page cache can utilize unlimited memory and is shared between instances
- Memory usage shown by `htop` includes OS page cache and may appear inflated

> ⚠️ **Disk Performance Warning:** Multiple instances accessing the same disk concurrently will impact performance due to increased random disk access. This is particularly problematic during the "Blocks Execution stage" which performs many random reads. **Avoid running multiple genesis syncs on the same disk.**

### 2. Database Configuration

For multiple instances, consider adjusting database parameters to reduce resource contention:

```bash
# Reduce memory-mapped database growth to minimize disk churn
--db.growth.step=32MB
--db.size.limit=512MB
```

### 3. Network Port Management

**Default Port Allocation:**

| Component | Default Port | Protocol | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|----------|---------|
| Engine | 9090 | TCP | gRPC Server (Private) |
| Engine | 42069 | TCP/UDP | BitTorrent (Public) |
| Engine | 8551 | TCP | Engine API (Private) |
| Sentry | 30303/30304 | TCP/UDP | P2P Peering (Public) |
| RPCDaemon | 8545 | TCP | HTTP/WebSocket (Private) |

### 4. Service Separation

Erigon supports modular deployment where components can run as separate processes:

For multiple instances, you can:
- Run each instance with integrated services (default)
- Separate heavy components like `downloader` or `rpcdaemon` to dedicated processes
- Use the `--private.api.addr` flag for inter-service communication

### 5. Monitoring and Logging

Configure separate log directories for each instance:

```bash
# Instance 1
--log.dir.path=/logs/mainnet

# Instance 2  
--log.dir.path=/logs/sepolia
```

For Prometheus monitoring, each instance should expose metrics on different ports.

## Performance Optimization

### Cloud Storage Considerations

If using network-attached storage, apply these optimizations:

```bash
# Reduce disk latency impact
export ERIGON_SNAPSHOT_MADV_RND=false
--db.pagesize=64kb

# For Polygon networks
--sync.loop.block.limit=10000
```

### Memory Locking for Performance

For production setups with sufficient RAM, you can lock critical data in memory: 

```bash
# Lock domain snapshots in RAM
vmtouch -vdlw /mnt/erigon/snapshots/domain/*bt
ls /mnt/erigon/snapshots/domain/*.kv | parallel vmtouch -vdlw
```

```markdown
vmtouch -vdlw /mnt/erigon/snapshots/domain/*bt
ls /mnt/erigon/snapshots/domain/*.kv | parallel vmtouch -vdlw
```

If it is failing with "can't allocate memory", try: 

```
sync && sudo sysctl vm.drop_caches=3
echo 1 > /proc/sys/vm/compact_memory
```

> **Warning:**: Running multiple instances of Erigon on the same machine will cause concurrent disk access, which can negatively impact performance. One of Erigon's main optimizations is to reduce disk random access, but the "Blocks Execution stage" still performs many random reads, making it the slowest stage. Therefore, **we do not recommend running multiple genesis syncs on the same disk**. However, if the genesis sync has already been completed, it is acceptable to run multiple Erigon instances on the same disk.

What can be done:

- reduce disk latency (not throughput, not iops)
    - use latency-critical cloud-drives
    - or attached-NVMe (at least for initial sync)
- increase RAM
- if you throw enough RAM, then can set env variable `ERIGON_SNAPSHOT_MADV_RND=false`
- Use `--db.pagesize=64kb` (less fragmentation, more IO)
- Or use Erigon3 (it also sensitive for disk-latency - but it will download 99% of history)

```yaml
# Ports: `9090` execution engine (private api), `9091` sentry, `9092` consensus engine, `9093` snapshot downloader, `9094` TxPool
# Ports: `8545` json rpc, `8551` consensus json rpc, `30303` eth p2p protocol, `42069` bittorrent protocol,

# Connections: erigon -> (sentries, downloader), rpcdaemon -> (erigon, txpool), txpool -> erigon
```

### How RAM is used

Erigon will utilize all available RAM, but this memory will not be directly owned by Erigon's process. Instead, the operating system (OS) will manage this memory. The OS will keep the frequently accessed parts of the database (DB) in RAM. If the OS needs to allocate RAM for other programs or for a second instance of Erigon, it will handle the memory management accordingly. This mechanism is known as PageCache.

Erigon itself consumes less than 2GB of RAM. Therefore, Erigon will benefit from having more RAM available, as it can use all of it without needing any reconfiguration. The same PageCache can be shared by other processes running on the same machine, simply by opening the same DB file. For example, if RPCDaemon is started with the `--datadir` option, it will open Erigon's DB and utilize the same PageCache. This means that if data A is already in RAM because it is frequently accessed and RPCDaemon reads it, it will read it from RAM rather than from the disk, leveraging shared memory.

```go
	// These are set to prevent disk and page size churn which can be excessive
	// when running multiple nodes
	// MdbxGrowthStep impacts disk usage, MdbxDBSizeLimit impacts page file usage
	n.nodeCfg.MdbxGrowthStep = 32 * datasize.MB
	n.nodeCfg.MdbxDBSizeLimit = 512 * datasize.MB
```
