# Otterscan

Otterscan is an Ethereum block explorer designed to be run locally along with Erigon.

Entirely based on open source code, it is blazing fast and fully private since it works on your local machine. The user interface is intentionally very similar, but with many improvements, to the most popular Ethereum block explorer to make it easy to locate where the information is.
