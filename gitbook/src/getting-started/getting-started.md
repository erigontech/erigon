# Getting Started

To use Erigon, you must first install the software. The current stable and production-ready version, fully documented in these pages, is **Erigon 3**.

There are several ways to install Erigon, depending on your operating system and preferred method (e.g., using a Docker container, pre-built packages, or building from source).

**Before proceeding with any installation, please carefully verify the following:**

1. [**Hardware Requirements**](hardware-requirements.md)**:** Ensure your machine meets the necessary hardware specifications (CPU, RAM, and Disk) for the type of node you plan to run (Minimal, Full, or Archive).
2. [**Software Requirements**](software-requirements.md)**:** These are <mark style="color:$primary;">only required if you choose to build Erigon from source</mark> (i.e., compiling the code yourself). Users choosing Docker or pre-built binaries can skip the specific software dependency requirements.
