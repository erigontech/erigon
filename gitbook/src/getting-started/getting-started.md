# Getting Started

In order to use Erigon, the software has to be installed first. There are several ways to install Erigon, depending on the operating system and the user's choice of installation method, e.g. using a package manager, docker container or building from source.

Verify carefully that your [hardware](hardware-requirements.md) satisfy the requirements and your machine is running the required [software](software-requirements.md).
