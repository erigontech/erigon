# Fundamentals

This section covers getting started with Erigon, detailing basic CLI usage and methods for configuring the client. It provides a complete reference for supported networks (including Layer 2s), default ports, and the different sync modes available.

A significant portion is dedicated to operational health, including optimizing storage, managing logs, and setting up security and TLS authentication.

Finally, it introduces Erigon's modular architecture by explaining the function of its core components (RPC Daemon, TxPool, Sentry, Downloader) and offers performance tricks and guidance on running multiple instances on a single machine.
