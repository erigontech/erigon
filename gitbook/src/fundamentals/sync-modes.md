# Sync Modes

Erigon 3 introduces a flexible approach to node configuration, offering three distinct types to suit various user needs. Depending on your need, you can choose from three different node types.

| **Prune Mode**         | **Flag**               | **Data Retained**                                                                                    | **Primary Use Case**                                                                     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \* Full Node (Default) | (No flag needed)       | Retains recent state, all blocks POST-Merge, and prunes ancient blocks and state (EIP-4444 enabled)  | General users, DApp interaction, fastest sync.                                           |
| \* Minimal Node        | `--prune.mode=minimal` | Only recent blocks                                                                                   | Solo staking, users with constrained hardware, maximum privacy for sending transactions. |
| Historical Blocks      | `--prune.mode=blocks`  | Retains the full block/transaction history, but still prunes the historical state before the merge.  | Users needing historical block data for research or indexing.                            |
| Archive Node           | `--prune.mode=archive` | All historical state                                                                                 | Developers, researchers, and RPC providers requiring full historical state access.       |

By **default**, Erigon run as a [full node](sync-modes.md#full-node), to change its behavior use the flag `--prune.mode <value>`.

In order to switch type of node, you must first delete the `/chaindata` folder in the chosen `--datadir` directory and re-sync from scratch.

{% hint style="success" %}
**\* Persisting receipts**, which are pre-calculated receipts, increase the requests-per-second (RPS) and improve the latency and throughput of all receipts and logs-related RPC calls.

They are enabled by default for **Minimal** and **Full Node.** They can be activated or deactivated with the flag `--persist.receipts <value>` .
{% endhint %}

## Archive node

Ethereum's state refers to account balances, contracts, and consensus data. Archive nodes retain all historical state and require more **disk space.** However,  Erigon 3 has consistently reduced the [disk space](../getting-started/hardware-requirements.md#archive-node-requirements) requirements for running an archive node, rendering it more affordable and accessible to a broader range of users.&#x20;

Archive are ideal for extensive research on the blockchain, developers, researchers, and RPC providers requiring a complete history of the state.&#x20;

## Full node

The default configuration in Erigon 3 is a Full Node. This setup is designed to offer significantly **faster sync times and reduced resource consumption** for daily operations compared to other clients. It achieves this by maintaining all essential data while intelligently pruning old, unnecessary historical data (blocks and receipts prior to The Merge, in line with [EIP-4444](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4444)).

We strongly recommend running a Full Node whenever possible, as its reduced disk space requirements make it suitable for the majority of users. By running a Full Node, you directly support the network's **decentralization, resilience, and robustness**, aligning with Ethereum's distributed ethos.

## Minimal node

The Minimal Node configuration (`--prune.mode=minimal`) is the smallest possible setup. By keeping only recent blocks, it is perfectly suited for **solo staking** and users seeking maximum **privacy** when interacting with the EVM, such as sending transactions directly through their node. This mode is the most suitable for users with severely constrained hardware.
