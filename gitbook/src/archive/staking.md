# Staking

Erigon is a comprehensive execution and consensus layer that also supports staking, aka block production, for Ethereum and Gnosis Chain. Both remote miners and Caplin are supported.

* Using a [external consensus client as validator](../get-started/fundamentals/staking/external-consensus-client-as-validator.md);
* Using [Caplin as validator](../get-started/fundamentals/staking/caplin.md).

Additionally, you can configure Erigon to work with [Shutter Network](../get-started/fundamentals/staking/shutter-network.md).
