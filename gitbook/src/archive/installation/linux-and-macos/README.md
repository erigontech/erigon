# Linux and macOS

There are 3 options for installing Erigon, listed from easiest to most difficult installation.

* [Use pre-built binaries](pre-built-binaries.md) **(Linux Only)**: Download and run the latest stable release of Erigon. This is the easiest option and requires no additional dependencies.
* [Use Docker](../docker.md): Run Erigon in a Docker container for isolation from the host system. This avoids dependencies but requires installing Docker.
* [Build from source](build-erigon-from-source.md): Build the Erigon source code directly on your system. This is the most complex option and requires following specific software requirements.
