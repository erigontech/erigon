    build: fix regressions with the -dlgo change (#21831)
    
    This fixes cross-build and mobile framework failures.
    It also disables the mac test builder because it was failing
    all the time in hard to understand ways and we can't afford
    it anymore under Travis CI's new pricing.

    build: add -dlgo flag in ci.go (#21824)
    
    This new flag downloads a known version of Go and builds with it. This
    is meant for environments where we can't easily upgrade the installed Go
    version.
    
    * .travis.yml: remove install step for PR test builders
    
    We added this step originally to avoid re-building everything
    for every test. go test has become much smarter in recent go
    releases, so we no longer need to install anything here.

    fuzzers: removed fuzzbuzz configuration (#21813)
    
    We decided to move our fuzzing efforts to oss-fuzz since fuzzbuzz is still early access.

    p2p/simulations/adapters/exec: fix some issues (#21801)
    
    - Remove the ws:// prefix from the status endpoint since
      the ws:// is already included in the stack.WSEndpoint().
    - Don't register the services again in the node start.
      Registration is already done in the initialization stage.
    - Expose admin namespace via websocket.
      This namespace is necessary for connecting the peers via websocket.
    - Offer logging relevant options for exec adapter.
      It's really painful to mix all log output in the single console. So
      this PR offers two additional options for exec adapter in this case
      testers can config the log output(e.g. file output) and log level
      for each p2p node.
