    node: allow websocket and HTTP on the same port (#20810)
    
    This change makes it possible to run geth with JSON-RPC over HTTP and
    WebSocket on the same TCP port. The default port for WebSocket
    is still 8546.
    
        geth --rpc --rpcport 8545 --ws --wsport 8545
    
    This also removes a lot of deprecated API surface from package rpc.
    The rpc package is now purely about serving JSON-RPC and no longer
    provides a way to start an HTTP server.

    p2p/discover: add initial discovery v5 implementation (#20750)
    
    This adds an implementation of the current discovery v5 spec.
    
    There is full integration with cmd/devp2p and enode.Iterator in this
    version. In theory we could enable the new protocol as a replacement of
    discovery v4 at any time. In practice, there will likely be a few more
    changes to the spec and implementation before this can happen.

    internal/ethapi: add CallArgs.ToMessage method (#20854)
    
    ToMessage is used to convert between ethapi.CallArgs and types.Message.
    It reduces the length of the DoCall method by about half by abstracting out
    the conversion between the CallArgs and the Message. This should improve the
    code's maintainability and reusability.

    all: fix a bunch of inconsequential goroutine leaks (#20667)
    
    The leaks were mostly in unit tests, and could all be resolved by
    adding suitably-sized channel buffers or by restructuring the test
    to not send on a channel after an error has occurred.
    
    There is an unavoidable goroutine leak in Console.Interactive: when
    we receive a signal, the line reader cannot be unblocked and will get
    stuck. This leak is now documented and I've tried to make it slightly
    less bad by adding a one-element buffer to the output channels of
    the line-reading loop. Should the reader eventually awake from its
    blocked state (i.e. when stdin is closed), at least it won't get stuck
    trying to send to the interpreter loop which has quit long ago.

    rpc: metrics for JSON-RPC method calls (#20847)
    
    This adds a couple of metrics for tracking the timing
    and frequency of method calls:
    
    - rpc/requests gauge counts all requests
    - rpc/success gauge counts requests which return err == nil
    - rpc/failure gauge counts requests which return err != nil
    - rpc/duration/all timer tracks timing of all requests
    - rpc/duration/<method>/<success/failure> tracks per-method timing

    crypto/ecies: improve concatKDF (#20836)
    
    This removes a bunch of weird code around the counter overflow check in
    concatKDF and makes it actually work for different hash output sizes.
    
    The overflow check worked as follows: concatKDF applies the hash function N
    times, where N is roundup(kdLen, hashsize) / hashsize. N should not
    overflow 32 bits because that would lead to a repetition in the KDF output.
    
    A couple issues with the overflow check:
    
    - It used the hash.BlockSize, which is wrong because the
      block size is about the input of the hash function. Luckily, all standard
      hash functions have a block size that's greater than the output size, so
      concatKDF didn't crash, it just generated too much key material.
    - The check used big.Int to compare against 2^32-1.
    - The calculation could still overflow before reaching the check.
    
    The new code in concatKDF doesn't check for overflow. Instead, there is a
    new check on ECIESParams which ensures that params.KeyLen is < 512. This
    removes any possibility of overflow.
    
    There are a couple of miscellaneous improvements bundled in with this
    change:
    
    - The key buffer is pre-allocated instead of appending the hash output
      to an initially empty slice.
    - The code that uses concatKDF to derive keys is now shared between Encrypt
      and Decrypt.
    - There was a redundant invocation of IsOnCurve in Decrypt. This is now removed
      because elliptic.Unmarshal already checks whether the input is a valid curve
      point since Go 1.5.

    cmd/evm: Rework execution stats (#20792)
    
    - Dump stats also for --bench flag.
    - From memory stats only show number and size of allocations. This is what `test -bench` shows. I doubt others like number of GC runs are any useful, but can be added if requested.
    - Now the mem stats are for single execution in case of --bench.

    les: create utilities as common package (#20509)
    
    * les: move execqueue into utilities package
    
    execqueue is a util for executing queued functions
    in a serial order which is used by both les server
    and les client. Move it to common package.
    
    * les: move randselect to utilities package
    
    weighted_random_selector is a helpful tool for randomly select
    items maintained in a set but based on the item weight.
    
    It's used anywhere is LES package, mainly by les client but will
    be used in les server with very high chance. So move it into a
    common package as the second step for les separation.
    
    * les: rename to utils

    The test failed due to what appears to be fluctuations in time.Sleep, which is
    not the actual method under test. This change modifies it so we compare the
    metered Max to the actual time instead of the desired time.

    eth: improve shutdown synchronization (#20695)
    
    * eth: improve shutdown synchronization
    
    Most goroutines started by eth.Ethereum didn't have any shutdown sync at
    all, which lead to weird error messages when quitting the client.
    
    This change improves the clean shutdown path by stopping all internal
    components in dependency order and waiting for them to actually be
    stopped before shutdown is considered done. In particular, we now stop
    everything related to peers before stopping 'resident' parts such as
    core.BlockChain.
    
    * eth: rewrite sync controller
    
    * eth: remove sync start debug message
    
    * eth: notify chainSyncer about new peers after handshake
    
    * eth: move downloader.Cancel call into chainSyncer
    
    * eth: make post-sync block broadcast synchronous
    
    * eth: add comments
    
    * core: change blockchain stop message
    
    * eth: change closeBloomHandler channel type

    cmd/devp2p: be very correct about route53 change splitting (#20820)
    
    Turns out the way RDATA limits work is documented after all,
    I just didn't search right. The trick to make it work is to
    count UPSERTs twice.
    
    This also adds an additional check to ensure TTL changes are
    applied on existing records.

    internal/ethapi: don't set sender-balance to maxuint, fixes #16999 (#20783)
    
    Prior to this change, eth_call changed the balance of the sender account in the
    EVM environment to 2^256 wei to cover the gas cost of the call execution.
    We've had this behavior for a long time even though it's super confusing.
    
    This commit sets the default call gasprice to zero instead of updating the balance,
    which is better because it makes eth_call semantics less surprising. Removing
    the built-in balance assignment also makes balance overrides work as expected.

    core/rawdb: improve table database (#20703)
    
    This PR fixes issues in TableDatabase.
    
    TableDatabase is a wrapper of underlying ethdb.Database with an additional prefix.
    The prefix is applied to all entries it maintains. However when we try to retrieve entries
    from it we don't handle the key properly. In theory the prefix should be truncated and
    only user key is returned. But we don't do it in some cases, e.g. the iterator and batch
    replayer created from it. So this PR is the fix to these issues.
