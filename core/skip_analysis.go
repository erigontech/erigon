// SkipAnalysis function tells us whether we can skip performing jumpdest analysis
// for the historical blocks (on mainnet now but perhaps on the testsnets
// in the future), because we have verified that there were only a few blocks
// where codeBitmap was useful. Invalid jumps either did not occur, or were
// prevented simply by checking whether the jump destination has JUMPDEST opcode
// Mainnet transactions that use jumpdest analysis are:
