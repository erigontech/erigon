 - Separated enums for environment, sub-databases, transactions, copying and data-update flags.

Deprecated functions and flags:

   Please use the value-to-key functions to provide keys that are compatible with the built-in libmdbx comparators.


## v0.8.2 2020-07-06
- Added support multi-opening the same DB in a process with SysV locking (BSD).
- Fixed warnings & minors for LCC compiler (E2K).
- Enabled to simultaneously open the same database from processes with and without the `MDBX_WRITEMAP` option.

- Added `ENABLE_UBSAN` CMake option to enabling the UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer from GCC/CLANG.
- Workaround for [CLANG bug](https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43275).

- Refined mode bits while auto-creating LCK-file.
- Avoids unnecessary database file re-mapping in case geometry changed by another process(es).
  From the user's point of view, the `MDBX_UNABLE_EXTEND_MAPSIZE` error will now be returned less frequently and only when using the DB in the current process really requires it to be reopened.
- Remapping on-the-fly and of the database file was implemented.
  Now remapping with a change of address is performed automatically if there are no dependent readers in the current process.
