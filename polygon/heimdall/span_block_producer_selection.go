// SpanBlockProducerSelection represents the block producer selection at each epoch
// with their corresponding accumulated ProposerPriority.
//
// In the context of the bor chain, an epoch is equal to 1 span, while
// in the context of the heimdall chain, an epoch is equal to 1 checkpoint.
// This data type aims to make this distinction a bit more visible and is
// intended to be used specifically for span based epochs.
//
// The difference between SpanBlockProducerSelection and Span.SelectedProducers
// is that SpanBlockProducerSelection contains the correct accumulated
// ProposerPriority for each selected producer, while Span.SelectedProducers
// always has ProposerPriority=0.
//
// This is because the heimdall/bor/span/<spanId>
// API only tells us what the "frozen" selected producers for the next span epoch
// are. More info about how that works can be found in the "FreezeSet" logic in
// heimdall at https://github.com/maticnetwork/heimdall/tree/master/bor#how-does-it-work.
//
// However, to correctly calculate the accumulated proposer priorities, one has to start
// from span zero, create a valset.ValidatorSet, call IncrementProposerPriority(spanSprintCount)
// and at every next span call bor.GetUpdatedValidatorSet(oldValidatorSet, span.SelectedProducers)
// and repeat.
