// borStateSyncTxnTracer is a special tracer which is used only for tracing bor state sync transactions. Bor state sync
// transactions are synthetic transactions that are used to bridge assets from L1 (root chain) to L2 (child chain).
// At end of each sprint bor executes the state sync events (0, 1 or many) coming from Heimdall by calling the
// StateReceiverContract with event.Data as input call data.
//
// The borStateSyncTxnTracer wraps any other tracer that the users have requested to use for tracing and tricks them
// to think that they are running in the same transaction as sub-calls. This is needed since when bor executes the
// state sync events at end of each sprint these are synthetically executed as if they were sub-calls of the
// state sync events bor transaction.
