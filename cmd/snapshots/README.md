# Snapshots - tool for managing remote stanshots

In the root of `Erigon` project, use this command to build the commands:

```shell
make snapshots
```

It can then be run using the following command

./buid/bin/snapshots sub-command options...
```

Snapshots supports the following sub commands:

## cmp - compare snapshots

This command takes the following form: 

```shell
    snapshots cmp <location> <location>
```

This will cause the .seg files from each location to be copied to the local machine, indexed and then have their rlp contents compared.

Optionally a `<start block>` and optionally an `<end block>` may be specified to limit the scope of the operation

It is also possible to set the `--types` flag to limit the type of segment file being downloaded and compared.  The currently supported types are `header` and `body` 

## copy - copy snapshots

This command can be used to copy segment files from one location to another.

This command takes the following form: 

```shell
    snapshots copy <source> <destination>
```

Optionally a `<start block>` and optionally an `<end block>` may be specified to limit the scope of the operation
