Integration - tool to run Erigon stages in custom way: run/reset single stage, run all stages but reorg every X blocks,
etc...

## Examples

All commands require parameter `--datadir=<datadir>` - I will skip it for readability.

```
integration --help
integration print_stages

# Run single stage 
integration stage_senders 
integration stage_exec  
integration stage_exec --block=1_000_000 # stop at 1M block
integration stage_hash_state 
integration stage_trie
integration stage_history
integration stage_tx_lookup

# Unwind single stage 10 blocks backward
integration stage_exec --unwind=10

# Drop data of single stage 
integration stage_exec --reset     
integration stage_history --reset

# Unwind single stage N blocks backward
integration stage_exec --unwind=N 
integration stage_history --unwind=N

# Run stage prune to block N
integration stage_exec --prune.to=N     
integration stage_history --prune.to=N
... 

# Run tx replay with domains [requires 6th stage to be done before run]
integration state_domains --chain goerli --last-step=4 # stop replay when 4th step is merged
integration read_domains --chain goerli account <addr> <addr> ... # read values for given accounts 

# hack which allows to force clear unwind stack of all stages
clear_unwind_stack
```

## For testing run all stages in "N blocks forward M blocks re-org" loop

Pre-requirements of `state_stages` command:

- Headers/Bodies must be downloaded
- TxSenders stage must be executed

```
make all
./build/bin/integration state_stages --datadir=<datadir> --unwind=10 --unwind.every=20 --pprof
integration reset_state # drops all stages after Senders stage (including it's db tables DB tables)
```

For example:

```
--unwind=1 --unwind.every=10  # 10 blocks forward, 1 block back, 10 blocks forward, ...
--unwind=10 --unwind.every=1  # 1 block forward, 10 blocks back, 1 blocks forward, ...
--unwind=10  # 10 blocks back, then stop
--integrity.fast=false --integrity.slow=false # it performs DB integrity checks each step. You can disable slow or fast checks.
--block # stop at exact blocks
--chaindata.reference # When finish all cycles, does comparison to this db file.
```

## "Wrong trie root" problem - temporary solution

```
make all
./build/bin/integration stage_hash_state --datadir=<datadir> --reset
./build/bin/integration stage_trie --datadir=<datadir> --reset
# Then run TurobGeth as usually. It will take 2-3 hours to re-calculate dropped db tables
```
