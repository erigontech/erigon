- extract useful info from .github/*.md files
- generate content and mtime cache for build cache defer trim
- make sure the race tests matrix can be invoked locally to reproduce.
- split tests into files, and balance them by run time. simplifies dupe checking etc.

deferred:
- Set installing Linux build essentials to default off, to find out which workflows actually need it.
- add parallel to all tests where possible, (mainly execution/tests), see what breaks
- always run lint first? that way we can have a single modcache, avoid running tests for build failures, and encourage good git push hygiene.
- merge workflows with similar triggers
- add a workflow that checks benchmarks work
