- extract useful info from .github/*.md files

deferred:
- Set installing Linux build essentials to default off, to find out which workflows actually need it.
- add parallel to all tests where possible, (mainly execution/tests), see what breaks
- always run lint first? that way we can have a single modcache, avoid running tests for build failures, and encourage good git push hygiene.
- merge workflows with similar triggers
- add a workflow that checks benchmarks work
