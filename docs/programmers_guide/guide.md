Turbo-Geth programmer's guide
==============================

Ethereum State
--------------
On a high level, Ethereum state is a collection of accounts. An account can be either a non-contract
(also known as "Externally Owned Account", or EOA), or a smart contract.

### Content of an account
Type `Account` [core/types/accounts/account.go](../../core/types/accounts/account.go) lists the main components
of an account's content (not identifier):

1. Nonce
2. Balance
3. Root
4. Code hash

#### Nonce
Number of the type `uint64`.

For non-contract accounts, nonce is important in two contexts. Firstly, all transactions signed by an account, have to
appear in the ledger in the order of strictly increasing nonces (without gaps). This check is performed by member function `preCheck` of
type `StateTransition` [core/state_transition.go](../../core/state_transition.go)
Secondly, if a transaction signed by an account is sent to no
particular address (with intention of creating a contract), and it ends up creating a new smart contract account, the address of such newly
created smart contract account is calculated based on the current nonce of the "creator" account.
For smart contract accounts, nonce is important when `CREATE` opcode is executed on behalf of such account. This computation is
performed in the member function `Create` of the type `EVM` [core/vm/evm.go](../../core/vm/evm.go). Note the difference between the
member function `Create2`, where the address of the newly created contract is independent of the nonce. For contract accounts,
the nonce is important in the context of creating new contracts via `CREATE` opcode.

#### Balance
Number of the type `*big.Int`. Since balance is denominated in wei, and there 10^18 wei in each Ether, the maximum balance that needs to be
representable is 110'000'000 (roughly amount of mainnet Ether in existence, but can be more for testnets and private networks),
multiplied by 10^18, which exceeds the capacity of `uint64`.

#### Root
Binary 32-byte (256-bit) string.

By root here one means the Merkle root of the smart contract storage, organised into a tree. Non-contract accounts cannot have storage,
therefore root makes sense only for smart contract accounts. For non-contract accounts, the root field is assumed to be equal to the
Merkle root of an empty tree, which is hard-coded in the variable `EmptyRoot` in
[trie/trie.go](../../trie/trie.go). For contract accounts, the root is computed using member function `Hash` of
type `Trie` [trie/trie.go](../../trie/trie.go), once the storage of the contract has been organised into the tree by calling member functions
`Update` and `Delete` on the same type.

#### Code hash
Binary 32-byte (256-bit) string.

Hash of the bytecode (deployed code) of a smart contract. The computation of the code hash is performed in the `SetCode` member function
of the type `IntraBlockState` [code/state/intra_block_state.go](../../core/state/intra_block_state.go). Since a non-contract account has no bytecode, code hash only
makes sense for smart contract accounts. For non-contract accounts, the code hash is assumed to be equal to the hash of `nil`, which is
hard-coded in the variable `emptyCode` in [code/state/intra_block_state.go](../../core/state/intra_block_state.go)

### Address - identifier of an account
Accounts are identified by their addresses. Address is a 20-byte binary string, which is derived differently for smart contract and
non-contract accounts.

For non-contract accounts, the address is derived from the public key, by hashing it and taking lowest 20 bytes of the 32-byte hash value,
as shown in the function `PubkeyToAddress` in the file [crypto/crypto.go](../../crypto/crypto.go)

For smart contract accounts created by a transaction without destination, or by `CREATE` opcode, the address is derived from the
address and the nonce of the creator, as shown in the function `CreateAddress` in the file [crypto/crypto.go](../../crypto/crypto.go)

For smart contract accounts created by `CREATE2` opcode, the address is derived from the creator's address, salt (256-bit argument
supplied to the `CREATE2` invocation), and the code hash of the initialisation code (code that is executed to output the actual,
deployed code of the new contract), as shown in the function `CreateAddress2` in the file [crypto/crypto.go](../../crypto/crypto.go)

In many places in the code, sets of accounts are represented by mappings from account addresses to the objects representing
the accounts themselves, for example, field `stateObjects` in the type `IntraBlockState` [core/state/intra_block_state.go](../../core/state/intra_block_state.go).
Member functions of the type `IntraBlockState` that are for querying and modifying one of the components of an accounts, are all accepting
address as their first argument, see functions `GetBalance`, `GetNonce`, `GetCode`, `GetCodeSize`, `GetCodeHash`, `GetState` (this
one queries an item in the contract storage), `GetCommittedState`, `AddBalance`, `SubBalance`, `SetBalance`, `SetNonce`,
`SetCode`, `SetState` (this one modifies an item in the contract storage) [core/state/intra_block_state.go](../../core/state/intra_block_state.go).

Organising Ethereum State into a Merkle Tree
--------------------------------------------
Ethereum network produces checkpoints of the Ethereum State after every block. These checkpoints come in a form of 32-byte binary
string, which is the root hash of the Merkle tree constructed out of the accounts in the state. This root hash is often
referred to as "State root". It is part of block header, and is contained in the field `Root` of the type
`Header` [core/types/block.go](../../core/types/block.go)

Prior to Byzantium release, the state root was also part of every transaction receipt, and was contained in the field `PostState`
of the type `Receipt` [core/types/receipt.go](../../core/types/receipt.go). Side note: that is why the member function
`ComputeTrieRoots` in the type `TrieDbState` [core/state/database.go](../../core/state/database.go) returns a slice of hashes,
rather than just a single hash. For pre-Byzantium blocks, this function computes state roots for each transaction receipt, and
another one for the block header. For post-Byzantium blocks, it always returns a singleton slice.

### Hexary radix "Patricia" tree
Ethereum uses hexary (radix == 16) radix tree to guide the algorithm of computing the state root. For the purposes of
illustrations, we will use trees with radix 4 (because radix 16 requires many more items for "interesting" features
to appear). We start from a set of randomly looking keys, 2 bytes (or 8 quaternary digits) each.

![prefix_groups_1](prefix_groups_1.dot.gd.png)
To regenerate this picture, run `go run cmd/pics/pics.go -pic prefix_groups_1`

Next, we sort them in lexicographic order.

![prefix_groups_2](prefix_groups_2.dot.gd.png)
To regenerate this picture, run `go run cmd/pics/pics.go -pic prefix_groups_2`

Next, we introduce the notion of a prefix group. Collection of adjacent keys form a prefix group if these keys share
the same prefix, and no other keys share this prefix. Here are the prefix groups for our example:

![prefix_groups_3](prefix_groups_3.dot.gd.png)
To regenerate this picture, run `go run cmd/pics/pics.go -pic prefix_groups_3`

The entire collection of keys form one implicit prefix group, with the empty prefix.

Merkle Patricia tree hashing rules first remove redundant parts of each key within groups, making key-value
pairs so-called "leaf nodes". They correspond to `shortNode` type in the file [trie/node.go](../../trie/node.go).
To produce the hash of a leaf node, one applies the hash function to the two-piece RLP (Recursive Length Prefix).
The first piece is the representation of the non-redundant part of the key. And the second piece is the
representation of the leaf value corresponding to the key, as shown in the member function `hashChildren` of the
type `hasher` [trie/hasher.go](../../trie/hasher.go), under the `*shortNode` case.

Hashes of the elements within a prefix group are combined into so-called "branch nodes". They correspond to the
types `duoNode` (for prefix groups with exactly two elements) and `fullNode` in the file [trie/node.go](../../trie/node.go).
To produce the hash of a branch node, one represents it as an array of 17 elements (17-th element is for the attached leaf,
if exists).
The positions in the array that do not have corresponding elements in the prefix group are filled with empty strings. This is
shown in the member function `hashChildren` of the type `hasher` [trie/hasher.go](../../trie/hasher.go), under the `*duoNode` and
`*fullNode` cases.

Sometimes, nested prefix groups have longer prefixes than 1-digit extension of their encompassing prefix group, as it is the case
in the group of items `12, 13` or in the group of items `29, 30, 31`. Such cases give rise to so-called "extension nodes".
They correspond to `shortNode` type in [trie/node.go](../../trie/node.go), the same type as leaf nodes. However, the value
in an extension node is always the representation of a prefix group, rather than a leaf. To produce the hash of an extension node,
one applies the hash function to the two-piece RLP. The first piece is the representation of the non-redundant part of the key.
The second part is the hash of the branch node representing the prefix group. This shown in the member function `hashChildren` of the
type `hasher` [trie/hasher.go](../../trie/hasher.go), under the `*shortNode` case.

This is the illustration of resulting leaf nodes, branch nodes, and extension nodes for our example:

![prefix_groups_4](prefix_groups_4.dot.gd.png)
To regenerate this picture, run `go run cmd/pics/pics.go -pic prefix_groups_4`

### Separation of keys and the structure

Our goal here will be to construct an algorithm that can produce the hash of the Merkle Patricia Tree of a sorted
sequence of key-value pair, in one simple pass (i.e. without look-aheads and buffering, but with a stack).
Another goal (perhaps more important)
is to be able to split the sequence of key-value pairs into arbitrary chunks of consecutive keys, and reconstruct the
root hash from hashes of the individual chunks (note that a chunk might need to have more than one hash).

Let's say that we would like to split the ordered sequence of 32 key-value pairs into 4 chunks, 8 pairs in each. We would then
like to compute the hashes (there might be more than one hash per chunk) of each chunk separately. After that, we would like
to combine the hashes of the chunks into the root hash.

Our approach would be to generate some additional information, which we will call "structural information", for each chunk,
as well as for the composition of chunks. This structural information can be a sequence of these "opcodes":

1. `LEAF length-of-key`
2. `LEAFHASH length-of-key`
3. `EXTENSION key`
4. `EXTENSIONHASH key`
5. `BRANCH set-of-digits`
6. `BRANCHHASH set-of-digits`
7. `HASH number-of-hashes`

The description of semantics will require the introduction of two stacks, which always have the same length. One
of the stacks (we call it "hash stack") contains hashes produced by opcodes. Another stack (we call it "node stack")
contains leaf nodes, branch nodes, or extension nodes of the trie being built.
In some cases, where the presence of a node is not required, the corresponding entry in the node stack is empty, or `nil`.
As well as the stack, the description requires the introduction of two input sequences (or "tapes"). The first tape contains
key-value pairs, each pair can be viewed as two opaque binary strings of arbitrary length, usually with the requirement
that the whole sequence is sorted by the lexicographic order of the keys, and all the keys are distinct.
The second tape contains hashes, each 32 bytes long.

N.B. Though there two stacks, we can sometimes just say "the stack", since they are always of the same size and are operated upon in unison.
For example, when we say that XXX pops something from the stack, we mean that XXX pops 1 item from the hash stack and 1 item from the node stack,
but then only one of those two items may be used later and the other may be discarded by XXX.

`LEAF` opcode consumes the next key-value pair from the first tape, creates a new leaf node and pushes it onto the node stack. It also
pushes the hash of that node onto the hash stack. The operand
`length-of-key` specifies how many digits of the key become part of the leaf node. For example, for the leaf `11`
in our example, it will be 6 digits, and for the leaf `12`, it will be 4 digits. Special case of `length-of-key`
being zero, pushes the value onto the stack and discards the key.

`LEAFHASH` has almost the same semantics as `LEAF`, with the difference that it does not need to produce the leaf node,
but only its hash (which can be more efficient in terms of allocations). It places `nil` onto the node stack.

`EXTENSION` opcode has a key as its operand. This key is a sequence of digits, which, in our example, can only be
of length 1, but generally, it can be longer. The action of this opcode is to pop one item from the stack, create
an extension node with the key provided in the operand, and the value being the item popped from the stack, and
push this extension node onto the node stack (and push its hash onto the hash stack).

`EXTENSIONHASH` has almost the same semantics as `EXTENSION`, with the difference that it does not need to produce the
extension node, but only its hash (which can be more efficient in terms of allocations). It places `nil` onto the node
stack.

`BRANCH` opcode has a set of hex digits as its operand. This set can be encoded as a bitset, for example. The action of
this opcode is to pop the same
number of items from the stack as the number of digits in the operand's set, create a branch node, and push it
onto the node stack (and push its hash onto the hash stack). Sets of digits can be seen as the horizontal
rectangles on the picture `prefix_groups_4`.
The correspondence between digits in the operand's set and the items popped from the stack is as follows.
The top of the stack (the item being popped off first)
corresponds to the highest digit, and the item being popped off last corresponds to the lowest digit in the set.

`BRANCHHASH` opcode is similar to the `BRANCH` with the difference is that instead of constructing the
branch node, it only creates its 32-byte hash. It places hash of the node onto the hash stack, and `nil` onto
the node stack.

`HASH` opcode takes specified number of hashes from the input sequence (tape) of hashes, and places them on
the hash stack. It also places the same number of `nil` entries onto the node stack. The first item consumed ends up
the deepest on the stack, the last item consumed ends up on the top of the stack.

This is the structural information for the chunk containing leaves from `0` to `7` (inclusive):
```
LEAF 5
LEAF 5
BRANCH 12
LEAF 5
LEAF 5
LEAF 5
BRANCH 023
LEAF 6
LEAF 6
BRANCH 0123
LEAF 5
```
After executing these opcodes against the chunk, we will have 2 items on the stack, first representing the branch
node (or its hash) for the prefix group of leaves `0` to `6`, and the second representing one leaf node for the leaf
`7`. It can be observed that if we did not see what the next key after the leaf `7` is, we would not know the operand
for the last `LEAF` opcode. If the next key started with the prefix `101` instead of `103`, the last opcode could have
been `LEAF 4` (because leaves `7` and `8` would have formed a prefix group).

After hashing the first chunk, the tree would look as follows.
![prefix_groups_5](prefix_groups_5.dot.gd.png)
To regenerate this picture, run `go run cmd/pics/pics.go -pic prefix_groups_5`

If we apply the same to produce the next chunk of 8 leaves, we will get to the following picture.
![prefix_groups_6](prefix_groups_6.dot.gd.png)
To regenerate this picture, run `go run cmd/pics/pics.go -pic prefix_groups_6`

And, after hashing the two remaining chunks.
![prefix_groups_7](prefix_groups_7.dot.gd.png)
To regenerate this picture, run `go run cmd/pics/pics.go -pic prefix_groups_7`

Now, if we were given the sequence of these hashes, we need to combine them to produce the root hash.

```
HASH 3
BRANCH 13
HASH 5
BRANCH 12
HASH 1
BRANCH 01
BRANCH 03
BRANCH 0123
HASH 5
BRANCH 012
BRANCH 013
HASH 1
BRANCH 0123
```

These opcodes are implemented by the type `HashBuilder` (implements the interface `structInfoReceiver`) in [trie/hashbuilder.go](../../trie/hashbuilder.go)

### Multiproofs

Encoding structural information separately from the sequences of key-value pairs and hashes allows
describing so-called "multiproofs". Suppose that we know the root hash of the sequence of key-value pairs for our
example, but we do not know any of the pairs themselves. And we ask someone to reveal keys and value for
the leaves `3`, `8`, `22` and `23`, and enough information to prove to us that the revealed keys and values
indeed belong to the sequence. Here is the picture that gives the idea of which hashes need to be provided
together with the selected key-value pairs.
![prefix_groups_8](prefix_groups_8.dot.gd.png)
To regenerate this picture, run `go run cmd/pics/pics.go -pic prefix_groups_8`

And here is the corresponding structural information:
```
HASH 2
LEAF 5
HASH 1
BRANCH 023
HASH 2
BRANCH 0123
HASH 1
LEAF 4
HASH 2
BRANCH 023
HASH 3
BRANCH 0123
HASH 2
LEAF 5
LEAF 5
BRANCH 012
BRANCH 013
BRANCH 0123
```

We can think of a multiproof as the combination of 3 things:

1. Sequence of those 4 key-value pairs
2. Sequence of 15 hashes
3. Structural information that lets us compute the root hash out of the sequences (1) and (2)

### Generating the structural information from the sequence of keys

In order to devise an algorithm for generating the structural information, we return to this picture
![prefix_groups_3](prefix_groups_3.dot.gd.png)
To regenerate this picture, run `go run cmd/pics/pics.go -pic prefix_groups_3`

It can then be readily observed that the first item in any prefix group has this property that its common prefix
with the item immediately to the right (or empty string if the item is the very last) is longer than its common
prefix with the item immediately to the left (or empty string if the item is the very first).
Analogously, the last item in any prefix group has the property that its common prefix with the item
immediately to the left is longer than its common prefix with the item immediately to the right.

The algorithm proceeds in steps, one step for each key-value pair, in the lexicographic order of the keys. At each step,
it observes two keys (sequences of digits) - current, and succeeding. Because the algorithm emits
opcodes that manipulate the stack (technically, two stacks, but because they are always of the same lengths, we can
just say "stack"), it keeps track of what is currently on the stack. Each prefix group which is currently being
"assembled" by the algorithm, has some number of items on the stack. This is being tracked by an item in the `groups`
slice. The index of the item in the slice is equal to the length of the prefix of the prefix group. And the `uint16`
value of the item is the bitmask, with one bit per digit (and also per item on the stack). Whenever the algorithm
emits an opcode that would push something on the stack, one of the items in the `groups` slice gains one extra bit
to its bitmask. When the algorithm emits an opcode that would pop one or more things from the stack, the corresponding
item gets removed from the `groups` slice. The slice `groups` is started off empty and it is shared between steps.
Algorithm's step can also be invoked recursively from another step, with current and preceding keys specified by the
caller.

A step starts with computing the prefix of the smallest prefix group that the current key belongs to. It is either
the common prefix of current key and the preceding key or the common prefix of current key and the succeeding key,
whichever is longer (if they are the same length, then they are also equal, so no ambiguity there).
If the common prefix with the succeeding key is longer, then the new prefix group is being created.
If necessary, `groups` slice is expanded (by adding 0 items) so that it has the same length as the common prefix.

The digit of the current key immediately following the max common prefix is called "extra digit".
The sequence of digits of the current key following that extra digit is the remainder (which could be empty).
The item in the `groups` slice corresponding to the common prefix (basically `groups[len(common prefix)]`) is modified
to include an extra bit corresponding to the "extra digit".
If this step of the algorithm was invoked on a key-value pair (non-recursively), then a `LEAF` (or `LEAFHASH`)
opcode is emitted, with the operand being the length of the remainder (zero if the remainder is empty).
If the step of the algorithm was invoked recursively, and the remainder is not empty, an `EXTENSION` (or `EXTENSIONHASH`) opcode
is emitted instead, with the operand being the remainder.
For example, for leaf `12`, the lengths of the common prefix with neighbours are 1 and 3. Therefore, this key will emit the opcode
`LEAF 4`, where 4 = 8 (original length) - 3 (max common prefix length) - 1 (one digit goes to the branch node for the prefix group).

The following, optional, part of the step only happens if the common prefix of the current key and the preceding key is longer or equal than
the common prefix of the current key and the succeeding key, in other words, if at least one prefix group needs to be "closed".
Closing a prefix group means first emitting opcode `BRANCH` or `BRANCHHASH`. The value for the operand is taken from the
item in the `groups` slice, which corresponds to the length of the prefix for this group. Once value is taken, `groups` slice is
trimmed to remove the used item. Secondly, closing a prefix groups means invoking the step of the algorithm recursively
(unless the group that was closed was the one with the empty prefix, which encompasses all the keys). For that recursive invocation,
the prefix of the closed group is used as the current key, and the succeeding key simply passed on. Preceding key is found as the
prefix of the current key of the length equal of the highest index of non-zero item in the `groups` (in other words,
the longest prefix of a prefix group which would have something on the stack). During the recursive invocation, the slice `groups`
is trimmed to match the length of the preceding key that was found.

We will walk through the steps of the algorithm for the leaf `30`, and then for the leaf `31`.
For `30`, the key is `33113123`. Its max common prefix with neighbours is `3311`. The common prefix with the preceding key
is longer than with the succeeding key, therefore the prefix group `3311` is being closed. The digit immediately
following this prefix is `3`. Since this is a non-recursive invocation, and the remainder `123` is 3 digits long,
opcode `LEAF 3` is emitted.
The optional part of the step happens, and he opcode `BRANCH 23` (closing the prefix group) is emitted. Slice `groups` contained
the bit for `2` in the item `groups[4]` already, and another bit for `3` has been added, therefore we have `23` as the operand.
Slice `groups` gets trimmed to contain only 4 items. After that,  the step gets invoked recursively
with current key being `3311`, and preceding key identified as `3` (there were no prefix group with prefix `33` or `331` yet,
this can be figured out by checking the `groups` slice, where the highest index with non-zero item is 1).

In the recursive invocation of the step,
max common prefix is `331`. The common prefix with the succeeding key is longer than with the
preceding key, therefore a new prefix group `331` is created. Slice `groups` gets extended to 4 items, and the fourth item
(`group[3]`) gets item containing one bit for digit `1`. No more recursion.

For leaf `31` (key `33132002`), max common prefix is `331`. The common prefix with the preceding key is longer than
with the succeeding key, therefore the prefix group `331` is being closed. This is the group that was created during the
step for leaf `30` described above. The digit immediately following this prefix is `3`. Corresponding bit is added to
the item `groups[3]`. Since this is a non-recursive invocation, opcode `LEAF 4` is emitted (4 is the length of the remainder `2002`).
The optional part of the step happens, opcode `BRANCH 13` is emitted, and slice `group` is trimmed to 3 items to remove the item `groups[3]`.
The step gets invoked recursively
with current key being `331`, and preceding key identified as `3` (there were no prefix group with prefix `33`).

In the recursive step, max common prefix is `3`. The common prefix with the preceding key is longer than with the
succeeding key, therefore the prefix group `3` is being closed. The digit immediately following this prefix is `3`.
The remainder `1` is non-empty, and since this is a recursive invocation, opcode
`EXTENSION 1` is emitted.
The optional part of the step happens, opcode `BRANCH 023` is emitted for the prefix group `3` being closed. Slice `groups` is
trimmed to just 1 item. The step gets invoked recursively again,
with current key being `3`, and preceding key empty.

In the deeper recursive step, max common prefix is empty. Since the common prefix with the preceding key equals to
the common prefix with the succeeding key (they are both empty). The optional part of the step happens, opcode `BRANCH 0123`
is emitted, and `groups` is trimmed to become empty. No recursive invocation follows.

The step of this algorithm is implemented by the function `GenStructStep` in [trie/gen_struct_step.go](../../trie/gen_struct_step.go).

### Converting sequence of keys and value into a multiproof

One of the biggest difference between Turbo-Geth and go-ethereum is in the way the Ethereum state is persisted in
the database. In go-ethereum, the model for persistence is Merkle Patricia tree. In Turbo-Geth, the model for
persistence is sequence of key-value pairs, where keys are either derived from account addresses, or from
storage indices. In this model, computing Merkle Patricia tree from part of data is a very commonly used operation.
This operation is called "Resolution" because it normally arises from a need to look up (resolve) some keys and corresponding
values, and later update them, thus requiring recomputation of the Merkle Patricia tree root.

We can use the concept of Multiproofs to define the resolution operation. If we have a set of key-value pairs, and we need
to "resolve" them, we effectively need to produce a multiproof for the given set of key-value pairs.
To produce such multiproof, we can use the algorithm for generating the structural information from the sequence of keys.
However, within the algorithm, choices need to be made between emitting `BRANCHHASH` and `BRANCH` opcodes (or, similarly,
between `LEAF` and `LEAFHASH`, and between `EXTENSION` and `EXTENSIONHASH`). Such choices
are conceptually simple to make - if max common prefix is also a prefix of any of the keys we are trying to resolve,
`BRANCH` should be emitted, otherwise, `BRANCHHASH` should be emitted.
However, in order to make these choices efficiently, the set of keys being resolved will be converted into a sorted
list. Then, at each point when the algorithm processes a key, it maintains references to two consecutive keys from
that sorted list - one "LTE" (Less Than or Equal to the currently processed key), and another "GT" (Greater Than the
currently processed key). If max common prefix is also prefix of either LTE or GT, then `BRANCH` opcode is emitted,
otherwise, `BRANCHHASH` opcode is emitted. This is implemented by the type `ResolveSet` in [trie/resolve_set.go](../../trie/resolve_set.go)

### Extension of the structure to support contracts with contract storage
When it is required to construct tries containing accounts as well as contract storage, and contract code, the
set of opcodes making up the structural information need to be extended by four more. Apart from that, a new input
sequence (tape) is added, containing the bytecodes of contracts.

8. `CODE`
9. `CODEHASH`
10. `ACCOUNTLEAF length field-set`
11. `ACCOUNTLEAFHASH length field-set`
12. `EMPTYROOT`

`CODE` opcode consumes the next item in the bytecode sequence, creates a code node and pushes it onto the node stack.
It also pushes the hash of the byte code onto the hash stack.

`CODEHASH` opcode consumes the next hash from the hash sequence, pushes it onto the hash stack, and pushes `nil` into the
node stack.

`ACCOUNTLEAF` opcode is similar to `LEAF`. It consumes the next item from the key tape. The rest of the semantics
depends on the value of the `field-set`. Field set can be respresented by a bitmask. In that case, bit 0 would
correspond to field 0, bit 1 (number 2) - to field 1, bit 2 (number 4) - to field 2. Currently, field 0 means
account nonce, field 1 means account balance, field 2 means contract storage, field 3 means contract code.

 * If field 0 is present in the `field-set`, the opcode consumes one item from the nonce tape (tape 0), otherwise
it assumes default nonce (zero). This becomes the nonce of the newly created account/contract node.
 * If field 1 is present in the `field-set`, the opcode consumes one item from the balance tape (tape 1), otherwise
it assumes default balance (zero). This becomes the balance of the newly created account/contract node.
 * If field 2 is present in the `field-set`, the opcode pops a node from the node stack and a hash from the hash stack.
This node or hash (in this order of preference) becomes the storage of the newly created contract node.
Storage root can be empty (that would introduced by `EMPTYROOT` opcode).
 * If field 3 is present in the `field-set`, the opcode pops a code node from the node stack and a hash from the hash stack.
This node or hash (in the order of preference) becomes the code or code hash of the newly created contract node.

Out of all the information collected through the tapes and the stacks (as directed by the `field-set`), an account leaf node
is constructed and pushed onto the node stack. Its hash is pushed onto the hash stack.
Field set is introduced to make the specification of what is an account extensible in a backwards compatible way.
If a new field is added to the account in the future, it can be introduced without a need to re-encode the pre-existing
structures.

`ACCOUNTLEAFHASH` opcode's difference from `ACCOUNTLEAF` is that it does not push the leaf node onto the node stack,
pushing `nil` instead. The hash of would-be account leaf node is pushed onto the hash stack.

`EMPTYROOT` is a way of placing a special value signifying an empty node onto the node stack. It also pushes the
corresponding hash onto the hash stack. This opcode is introduced because there is no way of achieving its semantics
by means of other opcodes.

Transaction processing
----------------------
The main function of Ethereum software is to continuously process blocks and generate some information as the result of this processing.
The diagram below shows schematically the main types of information being processed and generated.

For an ordinary (non-mining) node,
block headers and block bodies are coming from the outside, via the peer-to-peer network. While processing those, the node maintains
the view of the current state of the Ethereum (bright yellow box), as well as generates the timestamped history of the changes in the state
(this is optional). History of the state is shown as a series of dull yellow boxes. Some transactions also produce log messages, and those
are included into transaction receipts. Receipts are also optionally persisted and are shown as green stacks of sheets. Turbo-geth's
default mode of operation does not persist the receipts, but recalculates them on demand. It looks up the state at the point just before
the transaction in question (for which we would like a receipt), re-executes transaction, and re-generates the receipt. This can only
work if the history of the state is available for the period of time including the transaction.
To turn on the recording of the receipts instead of relying on the re-generation (access to the recorded receipts is normally faster,
but the recorded receipt take a lot of disk space), one needs to invoke `EnableReceipts(true)` on the object of the type
`core.Blockchain`.
To turn off the recording of the history of the state, one needs pass the corresponding field `NoHistory` as `true` in the `cacheConfig`
parameter when creating a new instance of `core.Blockchain` by invoking `NewBlockchain`.

Database
--------
### Preimages
To keep the Merkle Patricia trie of Ethereum state balanced, all the keys (either addresses of Ethereum accounts and contracts,
or storage positions within contract storage) are converted into their respective hashes using `Keccak256` hash function.
Since that function is preimage resistant, it is impossible to obtain the original key from its hash.
During some operations that involve iteration over the Ethereum state, only hashes of the keys are available, but users
are expecting the keys themselves. Examples:

 * `GetModifiedAccounts` computing the list of account addresses that had any changes within the given range of blocks
 * `StorageRangeAt` computing the list of non-empty storage positions in the given contract at the given block number

To convert the hashes of keys back into the original keys (also known as preimages), a specially dedicated bucket is kept
in the database. Keys in this bucket are the hashes, and the values are the preimages. The name of this bucket is
contained in the constant `dbutils.PreimagePrefix`. Preimage bucket is being updated in the function `savePreimage`
of the type `TrieDbState` in `core/state/database.go`.
