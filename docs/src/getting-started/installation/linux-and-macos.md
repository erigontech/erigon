*How to install Erigon 3 on Linux and Mac OS*

There are 3 options for running Erigon 3, listed from easiest to most difficult installation:

-   [Use pre-built binaries](pre-built-binaries.md): Download and run the latest stable release of Erigon. This is the easiest option and requires no additional dependencies.
    
-   [Use Docker](docker.md): Run Erigon in a Docker container for isolation from the host system. This avoids dependencies but requires installing Docker.

-  [Build Erigon from source](build-Erigon-from-source.md): Build the Erigon source code directly on your system. This is the most complex option and requires a working Go environment.
