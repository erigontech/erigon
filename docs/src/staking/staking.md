# Staking

*How to propose and validate blocks with Erigon*

Erigon is a comprehensive execution and consensus layer that also supports staking, aka block production, for Ethereum and Gnosis Chain. Both remote miners and Caplin are supported.

- Using a [external consensus client as validator](../staking/external-consensus-client-as-validator.md);

- Using [Caplin as validator](../staking/caplin.md).

Additionally, you can configure Erigon to work with [Shutter Network](shutter-network.md).
