# Basic Usage

Erigon is primarily controlled using the command line, started using the `./build/bin/erigon` command and stopped by pressing `CTRL-C`.

Using the command-line options allows for configurations, and several functionalities can be called using sub commands. To add a configuration flag to the command line simply add the argument and, optionally, its value:

```shell
./build/bin/erigon [flag]
```

for example:

```shell
./build/bin/erigon --chain=holesky
```

See [here](configuring-erigon.md) how to configure Erigon with the available flags.

## All-in-One Client

The all-in-one client is the preferred option for most users:

```bash
./build/bin/erigon
```

This CLI command allows you to run an Ethereum **full node** where every process is integrated and no special configuration is needed.

The default Consensus Layer utilized is [Caplin](caplin.md), the Erigon flagship embedded CL.

## Basic Configurationâ€‹

* Default data directory is `/home/usr/.local/share/erigon`. If you want to store Erigon files in a non-default location, add flag:

    ```bash
    --datadir=<your_data_dir>
    ```

* Based on the [sync mode](sync-modes.md) you want to run you can add ```--prune.mode=archive``` to run a archive node, ```--prune.mode=full``` for a full node or ```--prune.mode=minimal``` for a minimal node.
The default node is full node.
* ```--chain=mainnet```, add the flag `--chain=sepolia` for Sepolia testnet or `--chain=holesky` for Holesky testnet.
* ```--http.addr="0.0.0.0" --http.api=eth,web3,net,debug,trace,txpool``` to use RPC and e.g. be able to connect your [wallet](web3-wallet.md).
* To increase download speed add ```--torrent.download.rate=512mb``` (default is 16mb).

To stop the Erigon node you can use the ```CTRL+C``` command.

Additional flags can be added to [configure](configuring-erigon.md) the node with several options.


## Testnets

If you would like to give Erigon a try, but do not have spare 2TB on your drive, a good option is to start syncing one of the public [testnets](supported-networks.md#testnets), Holesky, adding the option `--chain=holesky` and using the default Consensus Layer, Caplin. You can also had the flag `--prune.mode=minimal` to have a node that is syncing fast while taking not so much disk space:

```bash
./build/bin/erigon --chain=holesky --prune.mode=minimal
```

## Help

To learn about the available commands, open your terminal in your Erigon 3 installation directory and run:

```bash
make help
```
 
This command will display a list of convenience commands available in the Makefile, along with their descriptions.


```

 help:                              print commands help

```

For example, from your Erigon 3 installation directory, run:

```bash
make clean
```

This will execute the clean target in the Makefile, which cleans the ```go cache```, ```build``` directory, and ```libmdbx``` db directory.
