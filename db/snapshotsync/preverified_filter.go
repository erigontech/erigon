// FilterPreverifiedByPruneMode returns the subset of preverified items
// the node should download given its prune.Mode + chain config. Used
// by the V2 bootstrap-from-preverified path in
// node/components/storage/provider.go so a publisher under
// --prune.mode=minimal doesn't pull the full archive (~1.9 TB of state
// history) it would just prune anyway.
//
// The filter intentionally captures only the prune-driven subset of
// SyncSnapshots' inline filtering loop. Other filters there (caplin
// mode, blobs, caplinState, headerchain, KeepExecutionProofs,
// PersistReceiptsCacheV2, SnapshotDownloadToBlock) belong to the
// running-node download path and don't apply identically at fresh
// bootstrap; the bootstrap caller is responsible for any additional
// kind-level filtering it wants.
//
// Rules applied here:
//
//  1. State-history files (idx/, history/, accessor/ — matched by
//     isStateHistory) are dropped when prune.History is enabled
//     (i.e. every prune mode except Archive). Archive keeps them.
//     This is the bug-N fix: without this drop, a --prune.mode=minimal
//     publisher at fresh bootstrap pulls the entire archive history
//     because there's no head-anchored prune horizon to filter against
//     yet (getMinimumBlocksToDownload requires frozen bodies on disk).
//
//  2. Pre-merge transactions are dropped per the existing
//     isTransactionsSegmentExpired contract (kept verbatim — the
//     condition is "Blocks == DefaultBlocksPruneMode AND IsPreMerge",
//     which only matches Full mode by current prune.Mode constants).
//
//  3. Receipt-cache and log-index files are NOT filtered here. The
//     running-node isReceiptsSegmentPruned check needs a kv.Tx +
//     TxNumsReader to compute the txNum at the prune horizon, neither
//     of which is available pre-Initialize. At fresh bootstrap the
//     receipts are kept; SyncSnapshots' running-loop applies the
//     finer filter once the node has bodies on disk.
//
// Divergence from SyncSnapshots' inline filter is intentional. The
// inline filter uses head-anchored predicates: it keeps state history
// at the prune horizon (range >= max(0, head-distance)) and drops only
// what's been retired off the tail. At fresh bootstrap, head==0 and
// the horizon collapses to "keep everything" — which is exactly the
// degenerate case bug N exposed. The bootstrap-side filter therefore
// applies an all-or-nothing rule: "if this prune mode runtime-prunes
// history, don't download any of it at startup; the publisher will
// rebuild what's needed during execution." Two filters, two contexts,
// two policies; trying to unify produces either an unsafe relaxation
// (bootstrap downloads things it would prune — bug N) or a wrong
// restriction (running-node keeps too little).
//
// The invariant the two filters share — and which
// TestFilterIsSubsetOfArchive pins below — is monotonicity:
// FilterPreverifiedByPruneMode(items, *, mode).len <= len(items) for
// every mode. The bootstrap-side filter never adds entries that
// weren't in preverified to begin with; SyncSnapshots' running-loop
// has the same property.
